		<h2>These are some pretty useful reagent combos, that make for great multi-effect potions</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				Bugloss, Columbine, Mountain Flower
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Creates a potion with Restore Health, Restore Stamina, and Restore Magicka. Restore Health is on all three items, and is thus boosted.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Corn Flower, Lady's Smock, Namira's Rot
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Creates a potion with Restore Magicka, Increase Spell Power, and Increase Spell Critical. Great for sustaining Magicka-heavy builds.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Blessed Thistle, Dragonthorn, Water Hyacinth
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Creates a potion with Restore Stamina, Increase Weapon Power, and Increase Weapon Critical. Serves as the stamina counterpart of the previous potion, and is similarly great for Stamina-heavy builds.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Columbine, Dragonthorn, Wormwood
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Creates a potion with Unstoppable, Weapon Critical, and Restore Stamina. Not a lot of synergy, but still three good effects.
