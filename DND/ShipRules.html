    <h1>Basic Ship Rules</h1>
    <h2>Your Ship</h2>
    <p>
      The stat block for your ship is <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/vehicles/sailing-ship">here</a>.
      One caveat is that the map there is inaccurate. Your ship, e.g., has a tiller instead of a wheel,
      is lacking the Lower Deck/Hold split, and instead has a proper bilge level.
      The basic map from GoS is <a href="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/5/387/03-pc.png">here</a> instead.
    </p>
    <h2>Ship Actions in Combat</h2>
    <p>
      If a ship's actions in combat matter, the ship rolls its own initiative, and takes its own actions, per the stat block.
      The number of crew working aboard the ship impacts how many actions it has.
      Note that any crew members who die, fall unconscious, work to repel boarders, etc., stop counting.
      Also, each of the ship's actions can only be taken once per turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, note that the ship components are individually targetable, have their own AC, etc.
      They also may have a Damage Threshold; anything that deals at least that much damage, is as normal.
      Anything that deals even one point less, deals no damage at all.
    </p>
    <h1>Officers</h1>
    <h2>Positions</h2>
    <p>
      Ghosts of Saltmarsh offers the following officer positions:
      <ul>
        <li>Captain: The captain issues orders. Useful abilities are Intelligence and Charisma, and useful proficiencies are Vehicles(Water), Intimidation, and Persuasion.</li>
        <li>First Mate: Supervise, encourage, and discipline the crew, keeping morals and efficiency high. Useful ability is Charisma, and useful proficiencies are Intimidation and Persuasion.</li>
        <li>Bosun: The bosun manages the boat, giving technical advice to the captain, and leades repairs and maintenance. Useful ability is Strength, and useful proficiencies are Athletics and Carpenter's Tools.</li>
        <li>Quartermaster: The quartermaster handles navigation, plotting the ship's course at sea. Useful ability is Wisdom, and useful proficiencies are Navigator's Tools and Nature.</li>
        <li>Surgeon: The ship's surgeon looks after sanitation, preventing disease spread, and healing injuries. Useful ability is Intelligence, and useful proficiencies are Herbalism Kits and Medicine.</li>
        <li>Cook: Works with limited and highly-salted ingredients to keep the crew fed. Useful ability is Constitution, and useful proficiencies are Brewer's Supplies and Cook's Utensils.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <p>
      Three positions (Captain, First Mate, and Bosun) have the authority aboard a ship to give special orders during combat, as an action.
      The first order is "Take Aim". One weapon, within ten feet of the officer, gets advantage on its next attack.
      The other is "Full Speed Ahead". The ship's speed increases by 1d6*5 feet. If multiple officers use this, only the highest applies.
      Both orders last until the end of the ship's next turn.
    </p>
    <h1>Crew Members</h1>
    <p>
      Crew members each use the Commoner stat block, if it ever becomes relevant.
      Crew will cost money, but I'm not yet solid on how much.
      At any rate, the Council has given you a crew of eight for a year, which puts it at the same eight crew and four officers that the smugglers had.
      This does limit the ship to two actions in combat, or one if the officers are engaging in combat, but the ship only has one action, since it's currently unarmed, so that doesn't really matter.
