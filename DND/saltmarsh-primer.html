    <h1>A Saltmarsh Primer</h1>
    <p>A.K.A. Saltmarsh's history, as your characters know it</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
      Saltmarsh is a small fishing village on the southern coast of the Kingdom of Keoland.
      Until recently, the only thing of note besides the fishing industry, was that it was a good spot to stop if you were travelling West from the provincial capital.
      The Kingdom itself paid little attention to its southern regions, focussing instead on a series of expansion wars in the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last decade, those expansion wars have mostly ended, with Keoland losing almost all of the territory it had briefly gained.
      The attention of the Crown has turned back inward, and found that the southern parts of the Kingdom are rife with
      smuggling, piracy, bandirty, other crime, unchecked monsters, evil cults, and all the other sorts of things you get in the wilder parts of a D&D world.
      An entire nation of pirates, the "Hold of the Sea Princes", has formed, and been flourishing for decades, raiding Keoland's coastline.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an effort to recover from the recent losses, King Kimbertos Skotti has decided that Keoland will be a mercantile nation, instead of a military power.
      Per the GoS book, "If Keoland cannot prosper as a military force, it must grow mightier as a center of trade."
    </p>
    <p>
      While the provincial capital of Seaton to the East is already much bigger than Saltmarsh, several have led to Saltmarsh getting much of the Crown's focus in the area.
      First, the nearby hills and seaside cliffs have shown signs of ore deposits, and a band of dwarves have started up a mine, bearing a decree from King Skotti himself that they should do so.
      Second, the Hold of the Sea Princes is to the West, making Saltmarsh the nearest large Keolish port, should the Crown actually deal with them.
      Lastly, Saltmarsh has little pre-existing political power, being a mere fishing village, so the Crown as been able to influence things more directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is a town that has become politically divided.
      Some believe that the Crown's attention can put a stop to smuggling, bring in more population and revenue, and breathe new life into Saltmarsh.
      Others see the Crown as meddling, fear that the Crown's influence will destroy their way of life, and just want to go back to living in a quiet fishing village.
      And, of course, the town's more criminal elements are simultaneously worried that the Crown's attention will bring down the law, but also keenly aware that it might bring new opportunities, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, with money flowing through, political divisions causing strife, and plenty of smugglers and pirates in the picture, Saltmarsh has attracted the attention of four mercenary adventurers...
