    <h1>A Saltmarsh Primer</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Saltmarsh is a small fishing village on the southern coast of the Kingdom of Keoland.
      Until recently, the only thing of note besides the fishing industry, was that it was a good spot to stop if you were travelling west from the provincial capital.
      The Kingdom itself paid little attention to its southern regions, focussing instead on a series of expansion wars in the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last decade, those expansion wars have mostly ended, with Keoland losing almost all of the territory it had briefly gained.
      The attention of the Crown has turned back inward, and found that the southern parts of the Kingdom are rife with
      smuggling, piracy, bandirty, other crime, unchecked monsters, evil cults, and all the other sorts of things you get in the wilder parts of a D&D world.
      An entire nation of pirates, the "Hold of the Sea Princes", has formed, and been flourishing for decades, raiding Keoland's coastline.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an effort to recover from the recent losses, King Kimbertos Skotti has decided that Keoland will be a mercantile nation, instead of a military power.
      "If Keoland cannot prosper as a military force, it must grow mightier as a center of trade."
