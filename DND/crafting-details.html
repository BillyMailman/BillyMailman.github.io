    <h1>Crafting Details</h1>
    <p>
      The crafting listing in the Downtime rules was getting too long, so I pulled this part out to a separate page:
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some examples of some things you can absolutely 100% make. Note that there is definitely overlap.
      <ul>
        <li>Alchemist's Supplies - Non-poison, non-potion items like Acid vials, Alchemist's Fire, Antitoxin, etc.</li>
        <li>Brewer's Supplies - Alcoholic drinks. See the Food, Drink, and Lodging table in the Expenses section of the Equipment chapter of the PHB.</li>
        <li>Carpenter's Tools - Large wooden objects that don't require precision crafting. Clubs, Shields, etc. are fine. Arrows/bolts/fiddly things, you'll need Woodcarver's tools.</li>
        <li>Cook's Utensils -  Meals. See the Food, Drink, and Lodging table in the Expenses section of the Equipment chapter of the PHB for an idea how much things cost.</li>
        <li>Herbalism Kit - Magic Potions</li>
        <li>Leatherworker's Tools - All armour that's primarily leather, also backpacks or any similar obviously-leather object.</li>
        <li>Poisoner's - Poisons. Obviously.</li>
        <li>Smith's Tools - All armour/weapons that are primarily metal, including metal shields. Also probably any other metal objects.</li>
        <li>Woodcarver's Tools - Most smaller wooden items, or medium-sized ones that require precision work. Arrows/bolts count, as do things like a wooden arcane focus, etc.</li>
        <li>Arcana - Arcana is used instead of tools for making magic items that aren't potions/scrolls (Potions use Herbalism proficiency, scribing scrolls is a separate activity).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that XGtE has a section on tool proficiencies which lists some uses for different tool types, and allows things like:
      <ul>
        <li>Crafting a small number of arrows during short rests, if you're low and have some wood available.</li>
        <li>Buying raw alchemical materials, and mixing them into useful items using Alchemists' Tools during a long rest</li>
        <li>Purifying water using Brewer's Tools</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
      </ul>
      These rules are separate from the crafting downtime rules, and absolutely in play.
