      This is a map of the southern coast of Keoland. As with the Saltmarsh map, markers will be added as the party discover things.

    <h2>World Map</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ujNlu12.jpg">In case it comes up, there's a good map of the whole Greyhawk known world, the Flanaess region, here.</a>
      This world map is roughly current-enough to when Ghosts of Saltmarsh happens.
      This map's hexes are 10 leagues, the same size as the large hexes of the Regional Map above.
      Saltmarsh is in the area between the Dreadwood and the Hool Marshes, 1/3 from the left and 1/5 up from the bottom.
