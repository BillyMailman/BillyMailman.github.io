    <h3>Locations</h3>
    <ol>
      <li value="1">City Gate: Reese entered through these gates. There's a section of wall which is old, crumbling, and badly worn by centuries of rain and wind off the Azure Sea. At all times, two to three guards stand watch here.</li>
      <li value="7">Faithful Quartermasters of Iuz: Captain Xendros leads a trade delegation, come to Saltmarsh mostly to buy large quantities of fish in the name of Iuz.</li>
      <li value="8">Empty Net: Partially supported by stilts driven into the harbor waters, this is the towns dive bar, filled with people who are probably pirates, smugglers, etc. Troublemakers are thrown out the back door, over the railing, and into the harbour.</li>
      <li value="15">Weekly Market: This market square opens every Saturday, and is host to traders bringing various goods in from afar. Items from the Playerâ€™s Handbook costing up to 150 gp are available for purchase here.</li>
      
    </ol>

    <h2>Regional Map</h2>
    <p>
      This is a map of the southern coast of Keoland. As with the Saltmarsh map, markers will be added as the party discover things.

    <h2>World Map</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ujNlu12.jpg">In case it comes up, there's a good map of the whole Greyhawk known world, the Flanaess region, here.</a>
      This world map is roughly current-enough to when Ghosts of Saltmarsh happens.
      This map's hexes are 10 leagues, the same size as the large hexes of the Regional Map above.
      Saltmarsh is in the area between the Dreadwood and the Hool Marshes, 1/3 from the left and 1/5 up from the bottom.
