    <h1>Downtime Rules</h1>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
      Because the Saltmarsh modules aren't a single consecutive campaign, we'll be using Downtime. See PHB Chapter 8, "Adventuring", the last section entitled "Between Adventures".
    </p>
    <p>
      This also means that your character's lifestyle will need to be chosen, and may matter somehow, details TBD.
      When we finish a module, I'll say something like "Alright, everyone level to X. It'll be Y days until the next adventure.",
      which means you need to spend enough gold for your lifestyle for Y days, but you'll also gain Y days to spend on downtime activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some activities, however, will eliminate the need to spend money on your lifestyle. Also, some class or background features may do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Downtime Activities from the PHB, DMG, and XGtE are available, with the following exceptions:
      <ul>
        <li>Building a Stronghold (DMG) - Unsuitable to a campaign on the seas.</li>
        <li>Carousing (DMG) - This activity plays out more like gambling. XGtE has another Carousing activity, and also has actual Gambling, so this is redundant.</li>
        <li>Most forms of crafting, buying, and/or selling Magic Items (DMG/XGtE) - GoS has a vendor. Healing potions are still craftable, and spell scrolls may be scribed</li>
        <li>Gaining Renown (DMG) - I don't plan to use the DMG's Guild/Organisation Renown mechanic.</li>
        <li>Training to Gain Levels (DMG) - We'll be using Milestone Levelling, based on the main GoS modules. No need to train.</li>
        <li>All the complications and Rivals stuff from XGtE - If you guys all buy into the idea, I can maybe use this, but the biggest problem I see is that it only works out-of-the-box with the XGtE Downtime Activities.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Downtime Activities</h2>
    <p>
      This is a list of downtime activities from official WotC books that you can do.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to do something, and it's not listed below, just ask me about it.
      For simple things, like "<em>I want to scribe all the spells from this spellbook we acquired into my book.</em>",
      or other class/race/etc. features that take time, we'll resolve it out with those features' rules.
      For anything else, give me a day or two, and I'll do what I can to come up with reasonable rules.
    </p>
    <h3>Buying/Selling/Crafting Items</h3>

        <div>
          <p>Allows you to gamble your money.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Costs five days and a stake of 10-1000gp</li>

            </li>
            <li>The check DCs are separate and unknown; the DM will roll for them (2d10+5 for each). This is gambling, after all.</li>
            <li>The results depend on the number of passed checks:
              <ul>
                <li>Zero successes, you lost your money, and also go in debt by that amount.</li>
                <li>One success, you lose half your bet.</li>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The check DCs are separate and unknown; the DM will roll for them (2d10+5 for each). This represents you not knowing what the competition will be, week to week.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Zero successes, you lose your fights, and win nothing.</li>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The results depend on the number of passed checks:
              <ul>
                <li>Zero successes, you are caught and jailed.</li>
                <li>One success, you get nothing, but escape successfully.</li>
                <li>Two successes, you get half the listed payout.</li>
                <li>Three successes, you get the listed payout.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              <ul>
                <li>You need to target a specific, wealthy, named NPC in town.</li>
                <li>Getting caught will have additional consequences beyond the normal level of general distrust that people would have towards a convicted criminal.</li>
              </ul>
