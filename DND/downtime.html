    <h1>Downtime Rules</h1>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
      As of now, the specific rules are mostly copied in from PHB/DMG/XGtE.
      I plan to make a quick pass over all of them and try to get them all to where the cost/benefit ratio in terms of days-spent is at least sensible, and they mostly all still have a purpose at higher levels.
      So assume it's all subject to possibly change before the campaign actually starts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changes I've made so far:
      <ul>
        <li>Proficiency added to crafting.</li>
        <li>Proficiency added to professions, which now make a profit.</li>
        <li>Adjusted time costs of magic item stuff. Might need more work. Tried to make the random option worthwhile.</li>
        <li>Made sure Uncommon magic armour wouldn't end up costing less than un-magic armour.</li>
        <li>Failing completely at crime is no longer guaranteed prison.</li>
        <li>Sped up training a lot. Probably will speed it up more.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the Saltmarsh modules aren't a single consecutive campaign, we'll be using Downtime. See PHB Chapter 8, "Adventuring", the last section entitled "Between Adventures".
    </p>
    <p>
      This also means that your character's lifestyle will need to be chosen, and may matter somehow, details TBD.
      When we finish a module, I'll say something like "Alright, everyone level to X. It'll be Y days until the next adventure.",
      which means you need to spend enough gold for your lifestyle for Y days, but you'll also gain Y days to spend on downtime activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some activities, however, will eliminate the need to spend money on your lifestyle. Also, some class or background features may do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Downtime Activities from the PHB, DMG, and XGtE are available, with the following exceptions:
      <ul>
        <li>Building a Stronghold (DMG) - Unsuitable to a campaign on the seas.</li>
        <li>Carousing (DMG) - This activity plays out more like gambling. XGtE has another Carousing activity, and also has actual Gambling, so this is redundant.</li>
        <li>Most forms of crafting, buying, and/or selling Magic Items (DMG/XGtE) - GoS has a vendor. Healing potions are still craftable, and spell scrolls may be scribed</li>
        <li>Gaining Renown (DMG) - I don't plan to use the DMG's Guild/Organisation Renown mechanic.</li>
        <li>Training to Gain Levels (DMG) - We'll be using Milestone Levelling, based on the main GoS modules. No need to train.</li>
        <li>All the complications and Rivals stuff from XGtE - If you guys all buy into the idea, I can maybe use this, but the biggest problem I see is that it only works out-of-the-box with the XGtE Downtime Activities.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Downtime Activities</h2>
    <p>
      This is a list of downtime activities from official WotC books that you can do.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to do something, and it's not listed below, just ask me about it.
      For simple things, like "<em>I want to scribe all the spells from this spellbook we acquired into my book.</em>",
      or other class/race/etc. features that take time, we'll resolve it out with those features' rules.
      For anything else, give me a day or two, and I'll do what I can to come up with reasonable rules.
    </p>
    <h3>Other Options</h3>
    <div class="box static">
      <div class="panel info">
        <h4>Other Features</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            You may have features from your class, or background, proficiency-related things,
            or any manner of options that take long stretches of time, or are otherwise meant to be done between adventures.
          </p>
          <p>Examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wizards/Tome of Ancient Secrets Warlocks can copy any spells they've gotten access to into their spellbook/tome.</li>
            <li>Some magic items may require that you spend time using them for certain features</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel info">
        <h4>Make stuff up!</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            The below are all based on official rules pulled from WotC books, but those books are pretty explicitly providing <em>examples</em>.
            Feel free to come up with your own ideas of what to do in town.

    <h3>Buying/Selling/Crafting Items</h3>
    <div class="box static">
      <div class="panel info">
        <h4>Buying Basic Equipment</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Not actually a downtime thing, but I'm listing it here.
            There are shops, merchants, and the like in Saltmarsh, from which you can buy most non-magical items.
            There are also likely places where you'll be able to sell most valuables.
            As per PHB, used equipment scavenged off enemies is likely salvagable by the party for their own use, but won't sell for very much money at all.
            Ordinary shops won't buy magic items, and won't be able to buy anything vastly out of the price range of things they sell.
          </p>
          <p>Shops you've found:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="locked-info">None</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel info">
        <h4>Selling Magic Items</h4>
        <div>
          <p>Allows you to sell magic items.</p>
          <p>Rules:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="locked-info">Must have met the appropriate broker in Saltmarsh</li>
            <li>Must have a magic item to sell, and must have identified what it is.</li>
            <li>Because they must make a profit, the broker will pay half what the item would cost.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel info">
        <h4>Hiring a Magic Item Broker (Specific items)</h4>
        <div>
          <p>Allows you to purchase a specific magic item</p>
          <p>Rules:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="locked-info">Must have met the appropriate broker in Saltmarsh</li>
            <li>
              Must spend a week negotiating with the broked on specifics of the item, haggling prices,
              avoiding letting them sell you crap for a high price, etc.
            </li>
            <li>Must be asking for a specific item from DMG Table F or G.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Prices are as follows:</p>
          <p>(Magic items that are also a weapon/armour/etc. cost the below, PLUS the item's base cost)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Common - 75gp</li>
            <li>Uncommon - 300gp</li>
            <li>Rare - 2,500gp</li>
            <li>Very Rare - 25,000gp</li>
            <li>Legendary - 50,000gp</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel info">
        <h4>Crafting (PHB)</h4>
        <div>
          <p>Allows you to craft items.</p>
          <p>Rules:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Requires proficiency with relevant tools.</li>
            <li>Requires the relevant tools.</li>
            <li>May require access to other equipment (forge for smithing, etc.)</li>
            <li>Must be crafting a non-magical object or Potions of Healing.</li>
            <li>Trinket-y Common magic items will probably also be available, I'll need to work out costs for them.</li>
            <li>For each day spent crafting, you spend up to (2.5*Proficiency) gold on materials.</li>
            <li>You make progress on crafting, equal to twice the value of what you spentm on materials.</li>
            <li>Multiple characters with the relevant proficiency may work together, each spending time and money, and pooling it together.</li>
            <li>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For smaller items that you can craft in under a day by the above rules, the remaining value can be rolled over into other items.
          </p>
          <p>
            E.g., a level 5 character who spends two days working on forging a greatsword would spend 15gp (7.5 per day) and make 30gp worth of progress.
            As a greatsword costs 50gp, they would then later need to spend two more days forging, with 7.5gp spent on the third day, and only 2.5 on the last.
            They could also, however, spend the remaining 5gp of their limit for that day, and make a 10gp item such as a battleaxe, or maybe two handaxes instead.
          </p>

      </div>
      <div class="panel info">
        <h4>Scribing a Spell Scroll (XGtE)</h4>
        <div>
          <p>Allows you to create spell scrolls</p>
          <p>Rules:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Must have proficiency in Arcana.</li>
            <li>Must have the spell known/prepared/etc., as appropriate to your spellcasting class.</li>
            <li>Must have any material components during scribing. If the components are consumed by casting, they are consumed in scribing</li>
            <li>Costs depend on spell level:
              <ul>
                <li>Cantrip: 1 day, 15gp</li>
                <li>Level 1: 1 day, 25gp</li>
                <li>Level 2: 3 days, 250gp</li>
                <li>Level 3: 5 days, 500gp</li>
                <li>Level 4: 10 days, 2,500gp</li>
                <li>Level 5: 20 days, 5,000gp</li>
                <li>Level 6: 40 days, 15,000gp</li>

          <p>Rules:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="locked-info">Must have met the appropriate broker in Saltmarsh</li>
            <li>Must spend 50gp to hire the broker's services for a given week.</li>
            <li>Two characters may not be doing this during the same week - she can only get in so much stock</li>
            <li>At the end of the week, the broker will have a number of random items available for purchase.</li>
            <li>Two items from DMG Table F, one each from A/B/C/D/E</li>
            <li>All items will then be available for purchase by the person paying the retainer fee.</li>
            <li>Anything they don't purchase, the rest of the party can opt to purchase instead.</li>
            <li>Anything not purchased at all gets removed from stock after a week</li>
            <li>
              Note that anything wildly outside the party's ability to purchase, I'll re-roll.
              No un-purchasable Legendaries at level 3.

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The results depend on the number of passed checks:
              <ul>
                <li>Zero successes, you are caught and may end up jailed.</li>
                <li>One success, you get nothing, but escape successfully.</li>
                <li>Two successes, you get half the listed payout.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>You need to target a specific, wealthy, named NPC in town.</li>
                <li>Getting caught will have additional consequences beyond the normal level of general distrust that people would have towards a convicted criminal.</li>
