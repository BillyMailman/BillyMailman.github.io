    <h1>The Defense of Saltmarsh</h1>
    <p>
      tl;dr: Choose Your Character!
    </p>
    <p>
      All the below characters are 95%+ ready to go.
      You're welcome to choose any of them.
      Some characters were left off the list that might have been worth putting in, but I didn't want twelve fighters.
      In fact, overall, I mostly aimed for one of each class, with only a couple of duplicates.
    </p>
    <p>
      That all having been said, if you want to play as someone the party have previously met, but who isn't in the list, mention it to me.
      As long as you can come up with a decent reason why they might be at the Empty Net dive bar late in the evening, then they're probably a viable option.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of numbers, none of these characters have a 20 in any ability score, mostly 18s in their main stats instead.
      All we built with point-buy, and most of them have various Tasha's Cauldron options turned on.
      Some exceptions and oddities exist due to trying to bash an NPC into a PC, and I've applied a spoonful of DM Fiat where absolutely needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equipment-wise, they all started with actual class/background starting gear, then had bits removed (not many people take ten torches and week of rations with them to a bar).
      Every character has at least something magical on them, but most don't have anything particularly useful.
      All spellcasters who have spells with costly/consumed material components have been looked at, and I've added relevant items to inventories.
      If it's not in their inventory, they probably have it, but it's at home.
    </p>

        <h3>Aryn</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/17172/746/1581111423-48805237.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Aryn">
        <p>
          Merfolk (Triton) Storm Sorcerer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aryn is a fairly successful merchant among the nearby merfolk population.
          In light of the Sahuagin war, she was able to parlay her knowledge of Common and Elvish into a position as ambassador to the War Council, which she’s since been using to try to expand her contacts and grow her business.
          Everyone who knows her has nothing bad to say, and she’s consistently described as kind, fair, polite, etc.
          Also, ruthless - her kindness is always done for a purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, she’s a Storm Sorcerer with lots of offensive spells, Mage Armour (already active at the start, with a slot expended accordingly), and the Failed Merchant background from Acq Inc.
          (she hasn’t failed, but it’s the closest option).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Bayleaf</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/16644/991/1581111423-47194469.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Bayleaf">
        <p>
          Wood Elf Lore Bard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bayleaf serves as a mercenary throughout the area.
          The party previously met Bayleaf working for the Elemental Eye cult on the Isle of the Abbey (See Recap 17).
          Sounds like Billy’s bad impression of Inigo Montoya.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, Bayleaf's background is as an entertainer, and he has the Actor feat as well.
          Spell-wise, he has a mix of healing, support and control spells, like any self-respecting bard.
          Level 6 Magical Secrets are Haste and Counterspell.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Captain Xendros of the Faithful Quartermasters of Iuz</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/16643/103/1581111423-47189221.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Captain Xendros of the Faithful Quartermasters of Iuz">
        <p>
          Fierna Tiefling Trickery Cleric.
        </p>
        <p>
          Xendros should need no introduction here at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her background is a customized version of Acolyte, and she has the Shadow-Touched feat mostly to mechanically add some more appropriate spellcasting to her, not because of lore reasons.
          Her spell selection mostly reflects the fact that she follows an evil god (Blindness/Deafness, Bestow Curse, Contagion, Insect Plague, etc.), though she does have Cure Wounds/Lesser Restoration as well.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Eliander Fireborn</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/16630/882/1581111423-47186309.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Eliander Fireborn">
        <p>
          Human Cavalier Fighter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eliander is a member of the Saltmarsh town council, and the head of the guard.
          He’s not local, having been sent here by the Crown as part of the attempts to turn Saltmarsh into a bustling trade hub.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, cavalier’s riding features likely won’t be useful, but the tanking aspects suit him well, as does the Interception fighting style.
          Being a former soldier, he’s built with a customized Soldier background, and he has the Skill Expert feat, taking expertise in Athletics.
          Also, Eliander speaks a LOT of languages.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Feign (Sarra)</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/16642/657/1581111423-47194981.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Feign (Sarra)">
        <p>
          Doppelganger (changeling) Redemption Paladin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sarra is a doppelganger who hired the party to help deal with problems with the nearby cult of St. Eadrine (See Recaps 7/8).
          Since then, she’s been living as Sarra, working as a mercenary in the area, and trying to do good under the real Sarra’s name.
          Nobody but Abe/Dripp/Reese/S.A.M. know her real identity as Feign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, she’s built as a changeling (close enough to doppelganger), with the Wildemount Faceless background being close enough to make it overall work.
          She’s a dex-based paladin, not strength, using a rapier, shield, and the dueling fighting style.
          Her spell selection is typical blunt and direct paladin fare (smite spells, magic/elemental weapon, etc.), alongside Redemption’s more support-focused spells.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Ferrin Kastilar</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/16644/191/1581111423-47193031.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Ferrin Kastilar">
        <p>
          Halfling Land Druid (Coast, obviously).
        </p>
        <p>
          Ferrin used to adventure for a while, but didn’t have the nerve for it, and retired to live his life as mostly a hermit in his grove in town.
          He manages a shrine there to Obad-Hai, and has helped (and been helped by) the party several times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, he’s a lotusden halfling, with a lot of the usual druid spells.
          Because Wellgar serves as the town’s main healer, Ferrin doesn’t have any healing spells prepared day-to-day.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Greta Amberhair</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/16642/548/1581111423-47199441.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Greta Amberhair">
        <p>
          Rock Gnome Artillerist Artificer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The party met Greta when they rescued her strange paddle-powered ship after a koalinth attack (See Recap 9).
          Since then, she’s gotten the ship running again, along with a new crew, and has been working on some inventions to help her defend from any further attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, her background is Clan Crafter to sorta-reflect her history as a gnomish tinkerer (ignore the dwarvish bits), and she has the Fade Away feat.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Keledek The Unspoken</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/17/229/636377844200136303.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Keledek The Unspoken">
        <p>
          Human Divination Wizard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keledek is Saltmarsh’s resident wizard, who has hired the party before (See, e.g., Recap 20).
          Keledek is a firm believer that knowledge is power, and you should never leave anything to chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, he’s a bit light on direct combat spells.
          Nevertheless, he has several prepared, including both Counterspell and Dispel Magic, as well as plenty of divination spells and the Lucky feat.
          He also has a very complete spellbook, meaning he has plenty of ritual spells available for use, should the party have time to use them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Oceanus</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/9094/455/637195296873267787.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Oceanus">
        <p>
          Sea Elf Hunter Ranger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The party rescued Oceanus from the Sea Ghost (See Recap 5), and have encountered him several times, as he served as a messenger between Saltmarsh and the region’s Sea Elf kingdom during the run-up to the Sahuagin War.
          Though it never came up, it was Oceanus who struck the killing blow on the Sahuagin Queen in the lower reaches of their lair.
          He’s taken a liking to Saltmarsh, seeing it as a sort of second home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, his hunter options are Colossus Slayer and Escape the Horde, he still has Favoured Enemy and Natural Explorer instead of their Tasha’s Cauldron replacements, though he has Primal Awareness instead of Primeval.
          His spells are all built around offense and attacks, and he wields a longbow with the Archery fighting style.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Sakith</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7265/215/637051197014387285.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Sakith">
        <p>
          Locathah Beastmaster Ranger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sakith has been serving as the Locathah ambassador to Saltmarsh as part of the negotiations leading up to the Sahuagin War.
          Sakith is a not-quite-minor noble back home, and though he doesn’t think that his nobility makes him better than others (he’s met plenty of nobles who are dicks), he does think that he himself is better than others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, he’s using all the Tasha’s Cauldron replacement features, including the Beast of the Sea companion option.
          His spells include healing, and he’s a dual-shortsword wielder, with the two-weapon fighting style.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Slate</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/17/184/636377836834995016.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Slate">
        <p>
          Human Wild Magic Barbarian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slate first met the party shortly after they finished exploring Stiobhard Manor (See Recap 3).
          He’s actually made of stone, and reverted for a while before Dripp was able to bring him back to life.
          His body is almost entirely made of stone and magic, which he can tap into if placed under enough stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, he’s built using the Goliath race, though he’s basically human, and actually doesn’t speak Giant.
          He has the Taven Brawler feat.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Tom Stoutly</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/17/274/636377863880121523.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Tom Stoutly">
        <p>
          Human Kensei Monk.
        </p>
        <p>
          The party first met Tom when he hired them to investigate the Isle of the Abbey (See Recap 16).
          Where his husband Will is relatively personable, Tom is awkward in civilian life, being uncomfortable outside the world of marine ranks and chain of command.
          He’s also not comfortable being in charge, deferring to Will.
          That said, Tom is a perfectly capable marine, and has done well in his job for years, now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, he’s a kensei strength monk, wielding a longsword, and with the Mobile feat and the dueling fighting style from the Fighting Initiate feat.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Vyth</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/17/439/636377887825063894.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Vyth">
        <p>
          Lizardfolk Scout Rogue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vyth was one of the lizardfolk who helped guide the party during their trip to defeat Thousand-Teeth (See Recap 7), and he and his friend Garurt have been serving as lizardfolk ambassadors to Saltmarsh ever since.
          Vyth is a rather law-minded civil-servant type, having served as a scaleshield guard for years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanically, Vyth is built with a customized City Watch / Investigator background.
          He has the Moderately Armoured feat to get him the signature Lizardfolk Scaleshield shield, and a LOT of skill proficiencies/expertises (10 prof, 6 exp).
          Also has a whopping 19 AC between his natural armour, dex, and shield.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Wellgar Brinehanded</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/17/225/636377843761000977.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp" alt="Wellgar Brinehanded">
        <p>
          Human Tempest Cleric.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wellgar is the town’s aged priest of Procan, running the local temple.
          In his younger years, he served as yet another sailor/fisherman aboard the town’s many ships, before a series of near-death experiences culminated in losing his leg.
          He has since retired to a life of religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wellgar is the town’s main healer, so mechanically he has plenty of healing/support spells, as well as Tempest’s subclass spells.
          He also has the War Caster feat, to help him fight in the thick of things while spellcasting.
          Unfortunately, while he does have a mace, Divine Strike, and the Crusher feat, his age and leg mean that his physical stats are somewhat mediocre.
          Nevertheless, his 18 AC is fairly solid, so he's far from useless in a fight.
        </p>
