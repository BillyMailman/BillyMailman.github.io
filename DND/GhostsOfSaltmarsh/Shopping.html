    <h1>Shopping Guide</h1>
    <p>All the stuff you can buy in Saltmarsh.</p>
    <h2>Weekly Market</h2>
    <p>
      Open every <span title="Saturday">Starday</span>,
      the weekly market allows the purchase of any non-illegal items
      (no poisons, poisoner's kits, thieves' tools, etc.)
      from the PHB (Chapter 5), with a listed value of 150gp or less, always at a cost of what's listed in the PHB.
      Reminder: This includes basic healing potions at 50gp.
    </p>
    <h2>Winston's Store</h2>
    <p>
      Saltmarsh's general store allows the purchase of any basic PHB gear you would expect sailors, fishermen, or other locals to buy regularly.
      Ropes, oil, nets, buckets, candles, food and rations, etc.
      The cost is exactly as listed in the PHB.
    </p>
    <h2>Reese's Shady Connection</h2>
    <p>
      Reese has, through his understanding of Thieves' Cant and resulting ability to get along with the town's various criminal elements,
      discovered a location in town where he is able to buy some of the tools of less-savory trades.
      The proprietor there isn't very trusting of the rest of the party, so Reese has been told not to spread this fact around.
      Anything that could be bought at the weekly market, but is illegal, can probably be bought here at the listed price.
    </p>
    <h2>The Dwarven Anvil</h2>
    <p>
      Mafera sells most all forms of metalwork here. Her basic stock is things like hammers, nails, etc.,
      and her backlog is long, but she increasingly owes a debt to S.A.M. for helping to smooth things over between her and the town dwarves,
      so she's both willing and able to make things like standard weapons and most standard armour for the party with a few days' notice.
    </p>
    <h2>Kester's Leather Goods</h2>
    <p>
      Kester can sell basically any non-magical leather goods that anyone in Saltmarsh might want.
    </p>
    <h2>The Faithful Quartermasters of Iuz</h2>
    <p>
      Captain Xendros is able to both buy and sell magic items. See the <a href="downtime.html">Downtime Rules</a>
      page for details of how to negotiate with her, including the value of magic items.
    </p>
    <h2>Temple of Procan</h2>
    <p>
      Wellgar Brinehanded will offer spellcasting services to others, though not always in exchange for gold.
      He is able to cast <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/class/cleric?filter-level=0&filter-level=1&filter-level=2&filter-level=3&filter-level=4&filter-level=5">spells from the Cleric spell list of up to 5th level</a>.
      He is also a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#TempestDomain">Tempest Domain</a> Cleric, so has access to a few more spells, but none of those are the sort of thing you're likely to need to buy in town.
    </p>
    <h2>Keledek The Unspoken</h2>
    <p>
      The town wizard has access to a supply of most material spell components, which he is often willing to sell for their listed value.
    </p>
    <h2>Ship Upgrades</h2>
    <p>
      Through various connections, the party are able to purchase a number of upgrades for the ship.
      Note that all the magical upgrades can also be browsed at <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/gos/of-ships-and-the-sea#SuperiorShipUpgrades">this Ghosts of Saltmarsh link</a>,
      though you'll want to avoid scrolling too far past them and into spoilers; there's sample encounters in that chapter that I may use.
    </p>
    <h3>Weapons</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Serenity</em> was captured having no shipboard weapons, but she could be fitted with some.
      The same ballista and mangonel option from the GoS <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/vehicles/sailing-ship">default sailing ship</a> are available.
      Because <em>Serenity</em> is shorter and wider than that sample ship, she can fit two ballistae on the forecastle instead of just one.
      Each siege weapon will cost 500gp to get built and installed, and will be done a week after the money is paid.
      During that time, you can still use the ship, but doing so will delay the install, and the weapon(s) won't be ready yet.
    </p>
    <h3>Superior Ship Upgrades</h3>
    <p>
      The following upgrades are also available through various contacts.
      Some will require dealing with Captain Xendros, some with the local Carpenters' Guild's head, some with Gellan Primewater, etc.
      GoS lists a flat cost of 15k gp, and 1d4 weeks spent in port once the work begins.
      Having a single flat price for everything like that is silly, and I've provided tentative alternate prices below.
      The work time will never be more than a single week.
      Leaving while the work is started may be possible, but will restart the timer on installation (though there will be no gold penalty).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note also that these are just the example upgrades from GoS.
      If you want <em>Serenity</em> to do something in particular, discuss it among yourselves and let me know!
      As with everything, I make no promises except that I'll see what I can do.
      Also, if you want an upgrade, but can't afford it, there may be a sidequest or three available from an NPC to try to reduce the cost.
      Similarly, the more expensive upgrades may require a sidequest as well as their price.

      <summary>Hull Upgrades</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Churning Hull (10,000 gp) - Rune-etched iron chains are draped off the ship's hull, channeling the fury of a storm into the sea.
          Water within 210 feet of the ship is difficult terrain for everything other than the ship.
          The chains will be attached to the hull, and can be hauled up before entering Saltmarsh harbour (or similar) and lowered to the water again once at sea.
        </li>
        <li>
          Death Vessel (12,500 gp) - Crafted of wood from the Shadowfell, this upgrade grants the ship an aura of dread.
          As an action, the ship can create a pulse of horrific energy. Every enemy of the ship within 210 feet must make a DC14 Wis save of be frightened of the ship for one minute.
          Failure gives 24hr immunity. Once used, this can't be used again for 1d4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Living Vessel (15,000 gp) - Crafted of wood from the Feywild, the ship partly becomes a living plant, drawing from the water and sunlight.
          The ship gains +2 to all Con checks/saves, and as long as the hull has 1HP, it regains 10HP/minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reinforced Hull (20,000 gp) - This hull is non-magical, and instead is simply highly reinforced.
          The hull's HP maximum is doubled.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vigilant Watch (5,000 gp) - A row of crystal orbs are mounted along the hull, each filled with viscous liquid and a beholder's eyeball.
          Invisible creatures are visible within 120 feet of the ship.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Movement Upgrades</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ever-Full Sails (15,000 gp) - Woven from cloud-stuff from the Elemental Plane of Air.
          The ship always moves at its full speed, as though it had the wind at its back.
        </li>
        <li>
          Defiant Sails (20,000 gp) - Coated with glittering mithral dust treated with abjuration magic,
          these sails give disadvantage to ranged attacks made by attackers not aboard the ship, against the ship or those aboard it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dragon Sails (12,500 gp) - Woven with dragon scales, these sails have +3 AC, and resistance to one damage type based on the scales used.
        </li>
        <li>
          Screaming Sails (17,500 gp) - Woven with the energy and spirit of wraiths and banshees, these sails allow the captain, as an action, to cause the sails to unleash a howl.
          Every hostile creature within 300 feet must make a DC 14 Wis save or take 4d6 psychic damage and be frightened of the ship for one minute.
          Once used, this can't be used again for 2d6 hours.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Weapon Upgrades</summary>
      <p>Note that each weapon can have only one Rounds upgrade, but can also have the Arcane Artillery upgrade.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Arcane Artillery (10,000 gp) - The weapon is made into a +2 magic version of itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Concussive Rounds (5,000 gp) - The weapon's attacks now burst with noise, disorienting the crew.
          If this weapon hits a ship's hull, that ship's speed drops by 2d10 feet until the start of this ship's next turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explosive Rounds (15,000 gp) - The weapon's attacks now deal 2d6 extra fire damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grasping Rounds (15,000 gp) - The weapon's attacks trail with spectral chains, stopping enemy vessels entirely.
          When these rounds hit a ship, it must make a DC14 Str save or it can't move away from this ship.
          As an action, this ship can end the effect, and the target can end it as an action by making a DC14 Str check.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>

        <li>
          Guardian Figurehead (25,000 gp) - Depicts an armoured knight. As an action, the ship can animate it as an Iron Golem.
          The golem acts on the ship's turn, using a ship's action to do so.
          One minute limit, then becomes the figurehead again and can't be used again for 24hrs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Red Dragon Figurehead (15,000 gp) - Depicts a red dragon rearing to strike.

        </li>
        <li>
          Storm Giant Figurehead (7,500 gp) - Depicts a storm giant hurling a thunderbolt.

        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Miscellaneous Upgrades</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bones of Endless Toil (Please no) - Please don't turn this into a necromancer ship. Please.<br/>
          <span style="font-size:smaller">(Bones festoon the ship, crawling with sickly green radiant runes. Humanoids dying aboard ship must make a DC12 Wis save or become a Zombie crew member for basically eternity.)</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Smuggler's Banner (20,000 gp) - A flag flown from the mast, this always appears to be the symbol of a group friendly to the viewer.
          Its true magic is that as an action, the ship and all friendly creatures aboard teleport up to three miles to a known desination chosen by the captain.
          Hostiles fall into the water.
          One used, this can't be used again for 2d6 days.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taskmaster's Drums (17,500 gp) - A four-foot tall drum with a pair of iron mallets.
          As an action, a creature can activate the drums. The hammers float above and strike the drum.
          For the next minute, the ship has one more action, as long as it has one action on its own.
          Once used, this can't be used again for 2d10 hours.
        </li>
