        <h3>Repairing the Manor</h3>
        <p>
          Finished on <span title="Saturday">Starday</span>, the 8th of <span title="December">Sunsebb</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abe paid to have the necessary basic repairs done, and Stiobhard Manor is now in much better shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other repairs can now begin.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="panel info">
        <h3>Abe's, Dripp's, and Reese's Bedrooms</h3>
        <p>
          Abe's finished on <span title="Monday">Moonday</span>, the 10th of <span title="December">Sunsebb</span>.
          Reese's finished on <span title="Tuesday">Godsday</span>, the 25th of <span title="December">Sunsebb</span>.
          Dripp's finished on <span title="Freeday">Friday</span>, the 7th of <span title="January">Fireseek</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abe, Dripp, and Reese paid to have bedrooms built (room 17 on the map for Abe, room ?? on the map for Dripp, room ?? on the map for Reese).
          Abe even did all of the construction work himself, for his room.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as they stay at Stiobhard Manor, Abe, Dripp, or Reese can now maintain any lifestyle for half price, needing to pay only for food.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="panel info">
        <h3>Alchemy Lab</h3>
        <p>
          Finished on <span title="Wednesday">Waterday</span>, the 12th of <span title="December">Sunsebb</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reese paid to get Caspar's lab fixed up, the walls reinforced, ventilation improved a bit, fire suppression installed, bribed appropriate OSHA officers, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reese can make any number of <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/-rPX9Up4">alchemical concoctions</a> for full price at any time,
          and can make up to two/day by spending downtime, reducing the cost by half.
        </p>

      <div class="panel info">
        <h3>Docks/Storage</h3>
        <p>
          Completed on <span title="Moonday">Monday</span>, the 17th of <span title="December">Sunsebb</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The area around the cave mouth has been cleared out and improved, and a basic dock has been built for Serenity.
          The caves themselves have also had their floors smoothed a bit more, allowing them to be easily used for storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any time Serenity isn't in use by the party, the crew can run short-haul trips to nearby areas, making a small amount of gold.
          This will pay for the crew.<br/>
          A downtime option is now also available, to run longer-haul trips to farther-off destinations. Details of this are still TBD.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="panel info">
        <h3>Kitchen</h3>
        <p>
          Completed on <span title="Sunday">Sunday</span>, the 23rd of <span title="December">Sunsebb</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kitchen is now fully functional, and the dining room has been cleaned and outfitted with a banquet table, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          All party members who have a bedroom at the manor now cut their lifestyle costs in half yet again.
          This also lets the party host people for dinner, or anything else that requires the proper kitchen to be working.

    <h2>Restoration rules</h2>
    <p>
      The following options are available to improve the manor.
      Each lists a requirement in terms of time, and gold, with the latter paying for both materials and labour.
      If you can't afford one in full, you're welcome to pay partially to get progress started, but can't make more progress on construction than the %-age paid.
      Any player character who wants to assist with a project is welcome to, but must have a relevant proficiency.
      For each day a PC spends assisting and supervising, subtract one day from the total time required.
      The gold cost won't decrease, however, and the extra day's worth of time must be paid in full.
    </p>

        <h3>Refurbish Bedroom</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: 300gp, 2 days.
        <p>
          One of the rooms (player's choice) will be outfitted as a proper manor bedroom.
          The exact details of what this implies, are up to the player.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will allow actually living at the manor, with better accomodations than your rooms aboard <em>Serenity</em>.

        <h3>Other ideas</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: ???gp, ? days.
        <p>
          I've just thrown together some ideas. Feel free to come up with your own uses for the rooms in the manor!
