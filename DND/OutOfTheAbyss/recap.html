    <h1>Shitty OotA Recap</h1>
      <h2>Session 1</h2>
      <p>
        Prison. NPCs! Lots of NPCs. Holy crap, that's a LOT of NPCs.
        Shitty breakout. Guard complacency. Looted weapons. Sent the changeling, got more stuff.
        Got spotted. Jumped a waterfall. Hit the water, spooky talking ooze. Run away!
        Heading to Kuo-toa city.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 2</h2>
      <p>
        Travel. Nothing first day. Second day, stream with water orbs. Set lookout, something dangerous. Fishing and gathering.
        Later day, ochre jellies. Easy defeat. Loot! Two acid, 2sp47cp, some paper shroom things, and some tongue shroom things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Details on companions. Shoushar sleepwalks with eyes open. The kids just want to get to safety.
        Dwarf lady is as straightforward as she seems, wants to get home. Sarith scratches himself like he had fleas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrived at lake. Head to Kuo-Toa town. Confronted by goons, wearing some strange patch on armour.
        Talked to them, discovered religious schism. Daughter of priest seeing visions, hearing voices, thinks she's prophet of new god.
        Convinced the goons to go after the drow chasing us. Faked two extra Kuo-toa to get past gate guards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Headed to old shrine, son of priest led us to priest. Got more details, sent scouts to other shrine.
        Ohshit, wacky fake god Leemogoogon is Demogorgon. Fucking demons.
        Had chat with daughter. Obviously crazy. Back to sane priest. Go with his plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sane priest fake-bound us, while two of us pretend to be Kuo-Toa.
        Sane priest, Shoushar, Lore and Nix all acted as guards, claimed sane priest had an epiphany, and rest of us were a sacrifice.
        Got taken to altar for sacrifice ritual. At key moment, Lore dropped the weapons Disguise Self was hiding, rest of us slipped the 'bindings' and attacked.
