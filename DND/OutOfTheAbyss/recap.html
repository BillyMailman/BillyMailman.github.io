    <h1>Shitty OotA Recap</h1>
      <h2>Session 1</h2>
      <p>
        Prison. NPCs! Lots of NPCs. Holy crap, that's a LOT of NPCs.
        Shitty breakout. Guard complacency. Looted weapons. Sent the changeling, got more stuff.
        Got spotted. Jumped a waterfall. Hit the water, spooky talking ooze. Run away!
        Heading to Kuo-toa city.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 2</h2>
      <p>
        Travel. Nothing first day. Second day, stream with water orbs. Set lookout, something dangerous. Fishing and gathering.
        Later day, ochre jellies. Easy defeat. Loot! Two acid, 2sp47cp, some paper shroom things, and some tongue shroom things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Details on companions. Shoushar sleepwalks with eyes open. The kids just want to get to safety.
        Dwarf lady is as straightforward as she seems, wants to get home. Sarith scratches himself like he had fleas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrived at lake. Head to Kuo-Toa town. Confronted by goons, wearing some strange patch on armour.
        Talked to them, discovered religious schism. Daughter of priest seeing visions, hearing voices, thinks she's prophet of new god.
        Convinced the goons to go after the drow chasing us. Faked two extra Kuo-toa to get past gate guards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Headed to old shrine, son of priest led us to priest. Got more details, sent scouts to other shrine.
        Ohshit, wacky fake god Leemogoogon is Demogorgon. Fucking demons.
        Had chat with daughter. Obviously crazy. Back to sane priest. Go with his plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sane priest fake-bound us, while two of us pretend to be Kuo-Toa.
        Sane priest, Shoushar, Lore and Nix all acted as guards, claimed sane priest had an epiphany, and rest of us were a sacrifice.
        Got taken to altar for sacrifice ritual. At key moment, Lore dropped the weapons Disguise Self was hiding, rest of us slipped the 'bindings' and attacked.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 3</h2>
      <p>
        Kill the evil Kuo-Toa. Don't kill the evil Kuo-Toa! Stop all the killing!
        Daddy Issues gets tied up and arrested safely. No demon invasion today!
        <span class="loot">225gp gained, plus an azurite gem, silver choker, and two potions of healing.</span>
        Also, LEVEL UP!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ditched some people. Gathered our party. Ventured forth.
        Boat to the trading post on the lake. Narrow passageways, bonked hears. Fished a bit, mostly just days of travel.
        Grell in a narrow pass. Kar'i'nas goes full anime. Gets rekt in response. Party pull through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrive at trade post. Cave and a beach. Beach has Crazy Lady in a tent. Traps galore!
        She's mad from demons. Ritter cures her for ten minutes. Get the password, promises he'll fix her for good someday. Head to the cave, and on to the trading post.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 4</h2>
      <p>
        Into Mantol Derith. Broken crystal elevator. Working cheap ones. Head up to the market. Four sections, Drow, Duergar, Svirfneblin, and Zhentarim.
        Split up. Selling/Buying.
        Lore and Nix being spies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check in with NPCs about what they want.
        <ul>
          <li>Dwarf Lady - Get home to surface.</li>
          <li>Derendil - Reclaim his lost kingdom and remove his obviously-not-real curse.</li>
          <li>Serith - Back to the crime scene at Neverlight Grove, clear his name.</li>
          <li>Stool - Get back home to Neverlight Grove.</li>
          <li>Ront - Ended up getting a job in the post. Gone from the party.</li>
          <li>
            Jimjar - Had to confront him to get a straight answer. Detect Thoughts employed.
            Was a former adventurer, got himself exiled-ish due to a gambling problem.
            He's technically allowed home, just isn't liked there. Mostly looking for something to do with life.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Spy shit from Nix leads to demon stone. Intercept it at the jewelers. Githyanki hazmat protocols and Paladin hazmat spells.
        Take stone to Sirak Mazelor, she confirms big demon inside. Fraz-Urb'luu. Cryptic poem from Lolth.
        Next day, able to banish him back to Abyss. Yay!
      </p>
      <p>
        Spy shit from Lore leads to Tongue mushroom in the food. Get the bigwigs of the Zhents and Drow talking. Chaos.
        Lore gets a job offer, the head Zhent human trying to kill him. Head Zhent beholder wants him to succeed. Job is in Gracklestugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Party has stuff to do nearby (Serith/Stool to Neverlight), so everyone catches another Kuo-Toa cab to Gracklestugh.
