    <h1>Shitty OotA Recap</h1>
      <h2>Session 1</h2>
      <p>
        Prison. NPCs! Lots of NPCs. Holy crap, that's a LOT of NPCs.
        Shitty breakout. Guard complacency. Looted weapons. Sent the changeling, got more stuff.
        Got spotted. Jumped a waterfall. Hit the water, spooky talking ooze. Run away!
        Heading to Kuo-toa city.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 2</h2>
      <p>
        Travel. Nothing first day. Second day, stream with water orbs. Set lookout, something dangerous. Fishing and gathering.
        Later day, ochre jellies. Easy defeat. Loot! Two acid, 2sp47cp, some paper shroom things, and some tongue shroom things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Details on companions. Shoushar sleepwalks with eyes open. The kids just want to get to safety.
        Dwarf lady is as straightforward as she seems, wants to get home. Sarith scratches himself like he had fleas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrived at lake. Head to Kuo-Toa town. Confronted by goons, wearing some strange patch on armour.
        Talked to them, discovered religious schism. Daughter of priest seeing visions, hearing voices, thinks she's prophet of new god.
        Convinced the goons to go after the drow chasing us. Faked two extra Kuo-toa to get past gate guards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Headed to old shrine, son of priest led us to priest. Got more details, sent scouts to other shrine.
        Ohshit, wacky fake god Leemogoogon is Demogorgon. Fucking demons.
        Had chat with daughter. Obviously crazy. Back to sane priest. Go with his plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sane priest fake-bound us, while two of us pretend to be Kuo-Toa.
        Sane priest, Shoushar, Lore and Nix all acted as guards, claimed sane priest had an epiphany, and rest of us were a sacrifice.
        Got taken to altar for sacrifice ritual. At key moment, Lore dropped the weapons Disguise Self was hiding, rest of us slipped the 'bindings' and attacked.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 3</h2>
      <p>
        Kill the evil Kuo-Toa. Don't kill the evil Kuo-Toa! Stop all the killing!
        Daddy Issues gets tied up and arrested safely. No demon invasion today!
        <span class="loot">225gp gained, plus an azurite gem, silver choker, and two potions of healing.</span>
        Also, LEVEL UP!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ditched some people. Gathered our party. Ventured forth.
        Boat to the trading post on the lake. Narrow passageways, bonked hears. Fished a bit, mostly just days of travel.
        Grell in a narrow pass. Kar'i'nas goes full anime. Gets rekt in response. Party pull through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrive at trade post. Cave and a beach. Beach has Crazy Lady in a tent. Traps galore!
        She's mad from demons. Ritter cures her for ten minutes. Get the password, promises he'll fix her for good someday. Head to the cave, and on to the trading post.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 4</h2>
      <p>
        Into Mantol Derith. Broken crystal elevator. Working cheap ones. Head up to the market. Four sections, Drow, Duergar, Svirfneblin, and Zhentarim.
        Split up. Selling/Buying.
        Lore and Nix being spies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check in with NPCs about what they want.
        <ul>
          <li>Dwarf Lady - Get home to surface.</li>
          <li>Derendil - Reclaim his lost kingdom and remove his obviously-not-real curse.</li>
          <li>Serith - Back to the crime scene at Neverlight Grove, clear his name.</li>
          <li>Stool - Get back home to Neverlight Grove.</li>
          <li>Ront - Ended up getting a job in the post. Gone from the party.</li>
          <li>
            Jimjar - Had to confront him to get a straight answer. Detect Thoughts employed.
            Was a former adventurer, got himself exiled-ish due to a gambling problem.
            He's technically allowed home, just isn't liked there. Mostly looking for something to do with life.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Spy shit from Nix leads to demon stone. Intercept it at the jewelers. Githyanki hazmat protocols and Paladin hazmat spells.
        Take stone to Sirak Mazelor, she confirms big demon inside. Fraz-Urb'luu. Cryptic poem from Lolth.
        Next day, able to banish him back to Abyss. Yay!
      </p>
      <p>
        Spy shit from Lore led to Tongue mushroom in the food. Get the bigwigs of the Zhents and Drow talking. Chaos.
        Lore got a job offer, the head Zhent human trying to kill him. Head Zhent beholder wants him to succeed. Job is in Gracklestugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Party had stuff to do nearby (Serith/Stool to Neverlight), so everyone caught another Kuo-Toa cab to Gracklestugh.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 5</h2>
      <p>
        Caved in section on the lake. Investigated, ancient tomb. Portaged the boat, then checked it out.
        Magic crap going on. Half-elf tomb. Disembodied voice!
      </p>
      <p>
        Sarcophagi. Opened, ghosts! Turned, defeated. Wild Magic!
        Loot. Retreat, heal. Headed back, found trapdoor. Scary ghost. Ambush! Dawnbringer found. Necklace of Fireballs, too.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 6</h2>

      </p>
      <p>
        Split up. Lore met up with Thieves' Guild. Looking for a red dragon egg. Disguise, headed into tunnels. Spiders!
      </p>
      <h2>Session 7</h2>
      <p>
        Backed off, rested up. Headed back further in. Room with stairs to dais. Crazy spy shit, hear the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patch of fungus with snakes. Tried another path. Room with an obelisk, and Derro lady. And a red dragon egg! Faerzress-heavy. Fight! Spectator. Fog Cloud shut down casters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Left egg. Took book. Exposition! Backed off, rested. Messaged Themberchaud. Got a meeting. Made a deal, deliver egg to dragon. Went back, swiped it.
        Seen on way out, but bluffed past the Derro. Egg wasn't seen. Took it to the docks, turned it over to the dragon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Got loot, needed to leave town. Dragon helped get outside city limits. Traveling to Neverlight. Mind Flayers? Beetles!
        Arrive at Neverlight. Thanked for returning Stool. Festival. Festival! Festival?
      </p>
      <h2>Session 8</h2>
      <p>
        Head in. Hunters returning. Lead hunter chats. Has side jobs and info. Basidia is one leader, still sane. Phylo is the other, obviously demon'd, leading the local cult.
        Talk to them, talk to other leaders. Not sure who to trust. Leader of explorers is especially twitchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hunting for cash! Otyugh fight. Easy find, easy kill. Shambling Mound, not much worse. Short rest, heal up people who caught diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saerith remembers! Was spore-poisoned all along. Local spores cause demon madness. Yay. He shares some info on the locked-off spot with the demon goings-on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Head out to kill Grick Alpha, ambushed by a Vrock. Nasty poison, but fine. Head to the Grick, get ambushed, but prevail. Return. Potions of Greater Healing all around!
      </p>
      <h2>Session 9</h2>
      <p>
        Gathering intel. Speak with Animals, then BatCat. Guards on the way to the back cavern. Spore Servant'd Chuul. Circle of Myconids, garden of corpses. Biiiiiiig shroom. Zuggtmoy!
      </p>
      <p>
        Long rest, plan to pull off shenanigans next day. Before trying to assault, Ritter cures Phylo of the spore madness. Success! Two leader allies!
      </p>
      <p>
        Get help from other leaders by curing. Skip the guards, explore the cavern. Dying drow helps, get their gear. +2 sword, +2 armour, bag of holding, scrolls. Giant Slug fight!
      </p>
      <p>
        Small back cave. Wedding rehearsal. FIREBALL! FIREBALL! No more rehearsal. Return to main cave. Not dealing with Zuggtmoy now. Place will be evacuated, adequately labeled as a biohazard site, and boarded up. Help evacuate the Myconids.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving Neverlight Grove. Head to Mantol Derith again. Not taking the taxi. Dragon hatches!
      </p>

        More travel. Ambushed on waking. Drow assassin. Sun Blade and Leomund's. Get Rekt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loot a map. Assassin's been searching. For us? Map doesn't show some paths in full. Investigate, find secret entrance to Mantol. No password, but not needed. Leave evil note.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loop around, head in door we know. Pointedly ignore looking at crazy lady. Sell emeralds, pool cash, get Umixit to scribe Remove Curse. Will be available after preparing in morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Head to Lore's thing. Stick together, since someone in town <em>does</em> want him dead. Ambush, another drow assassin. Rooftop this time. Nearly one-shotted Lore. Didn't survive to take a second shot.
