    <h1>Characters We've Met</h1>
    <h2>In the prison</h2>
    <p>
      <strong title="Name forgotten">Derro Bro</strong><br>
      Less crazy than most Derro. Tackle-yeeted a Quaggoth for the group. Awarded prison break MVP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong title="Name forgotten">Dwarf Lady</strong><br>
      Hasn't talked too much, was hanging back a lot in the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Erendil</strong><br>
      Totally 100% an elf prince with a curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Jimjar</strong><br>
      Svirfneblin commando. Probably the most bad-ass person in that prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ront</strong><br>
      Angry orc. Kind of a dick, but decent in a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sarith</strong><br>
      Dark elf. He was accused of murder, and may or may not be guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong title="Questionable Spelling">Shoushar?</strong><br>
      Seems less crazy than most.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Stool</strong><br>
      Myconid child. Can help us all talk to each other psychically.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Topsy and Turvy</strong><br>
      Gnome children. They're quiet, but seem to have befriended Umixit.
    </p>
    <h2>
      In Sloobludop
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong title="Real Name Unknown">Sane archpriest dude</strong>
      Basically the town's leader, pre-schism. Raised a fine upstanding son, and a daughter. Worhips Blibdoolpoolp. Fairly sane, for a Kuo-Toa.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong title="Real Name Unknown">Sane archpriest dude's son</strong>
      Lesser priest around the Blibdoolpoolp shrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong title="Real Name Unknown">Daddy Issues</strong>
      Archpriest's daughter. Worships Leemogoogon, which is really Demogorgon. Overall, pretty fucked in the head.
      Very much earned the party's nickname for her.
