    <h1>Characters We've Met</h1>
    <h2>In the prison</h2>
    <p>
      <strong title="Name forgotten">Derro Bro</strong><br>
      Less crazy than most Derro. Tackle-yeeted a Quaggoth for the group. Awarded prison break MVP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><span title="Name forgotten">Dwarf Lady</span> (In Party)</strong><br>
      Hasn't talked too much, was hanging back a lot in the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Erendil (In Party)</strong><br>
      Totally 100% an elf prince with a curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Jimjar (In Party)</strong><br>
      Svirfneblin commando. Probably the most bad-ass person in that prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ront (In Party)</strong><br>
      Angry orc. Kind of a dick, but decent in a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sarith (In Party)</strong><br>
      Dark elf. He was accused of murder, and may or may not be guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong title="Questionable Spelling">Shoushar?</strong><br>
      Seems less crazy than most.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Stool (In Party)</strong><br>
      Myconid child. Can help us all talk to each other psychically.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Topsy and Turvy</strong><br>
      Gnome children. They're quiet, but seem to have befriended Umixit.
    </p>
    <h2>
      In Sloobludop
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong title="Real Name Unknown">Sane archpriest dude</strong><br>
      Basically the town's leader, pre-schism. Raised a fine upstanding son, and a daughter. Worhips Blibdoolpoolp. Fairly sane, for a Kuo-Toa.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong title="Real Name Unknown">Sane archpriest dude's son</strong><br>
      Lesser priest around the Blibdoolpoolp shrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong title="Real Name Unknown">Daddy Issues</strong><br>
      Archpriest's daughter. Worships Leemogoogon, which is really Demogorgon. Overall, pretty fucked in the head.
      Very much earned the party's nickname for her.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span title="spelling?">Mental Derrith</span> Trading Post
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Ristea</strong> (Crazy Lady)<br>
      Driven insane by demonic influence. Paranoid to the extreme. Member of the Harpers, but thinks they're out to get her. Also thinks the Zhents are out to get her. Also, does not speak languages well.
