    <h1>House/Variant Rules</h1>
    <h2>WotC optional rules</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Diagonal Movement</strong> -
      The DMG's rule for diagonal movement on a grid (I.E. "Just count it as 5ft") is damn simple and handy,
      and technically optional, since grids are optional.
      Any time we have combat going with a grid down, it's the rule we'll be using.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Feats</strong> -
      Yes. Go for it.
    </p>
    <h2>Stuff from XGtE</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>General</strong> -
      Chapter 2 of Xanathar's has a bunch of 'optional rules' that are more like suggested, semi-official rulings
      on how to handle stuff that's not explicitly covered in the base books.
      The rules there for Simultaneous Effects, Falling, Sleep, Adamantine Weapons, Tying Knots, and Tool Proficiencies are all in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spellcasting</strong> -
      The Spellcasting rule for Identifying a Spell is in, with <em>one minor addendum</em>:
      If you use your reaction to identify a spell, you can use the same reaction to cast a reaction-casting-time spell you could have also cast.
      <br/>
      In other words, if you use your reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, you can also Counterspell that spell.
      You can use Counterspell in this way whether or not you identified the spell correctly.
      <br/>
      The rule for Invalid Spell Targets is exactly how I'd rule things anyway, so that's also in.
      The methods for handling Areas of Effect on a Grid, on the other hand, just seem like more work than eyeballing/counting squares, so I'll probably do that, at least at first.
    </p>
    <h2>Stuff from GoS</h2>
    <p>
      GoS has its own rules for handling ships, if-and-when their statblocks/actions become relevant.
      In short, ships have statblocks, and those list most of the details of how that ship works.
      Those statblocks do not include AC or HP for the ship. Instead, each ship component has an AC/HP.
      One component is always the hull, and if that one loses all its HP, the ship sinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      All ships are immune to Poison and Psychic damage, as well as the Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Exhaustion, Frightened, Incapacitated, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned, Prone, Stunned, and Unconscious conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ship rolls initiative and acts on its turn during combat, as normal.
      Ships can't take any of the normal actions available to creatures, and can't even move without taking an action.
      Instead, they have some number of actions available per turn, and a list of possible actions.
      Each action can only be taken once per turn, and many actions require a specific ship component to be installed, functioning (I.E. HP>0), and crewed.
      Officers aboard the ship may have actions that impact the ship's actions.
    </p>
    <h2>House Rules</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Ammunition</strong> -
      Because players rarely track ammunition well enough to recover half correctly after combat, and/or just don't bother recovering, the following effect is in play:<br/>
      All standard ammunition you receive, whether at character creation, purchasing, or loot, is doubled.
      Ammunition that you fire is always just lost.
      For the purpose of this rule, ammunition is arrows, crossbow bolts, blowgun needles, or sling bullets, as found in the Ammunition table in the Adventuring Gear section in the Equipment chapter of the PHB.
      <br/>
      The above rule does not change non-magical ammunition in any way, nor thrown weapons.
