        Session 1
      </summary>
      <div>
        <p>
          Our four intrepid adventurers, Abraham, Dripp, Reese, and S.A.M., met up on the docks of Saltmarsh,
          and agreed to work together to explore the abandoned and haunted home of Caspar Stiobhard.
          After hearing an old poacher's tales of a horde of ghosts, they did some shopping, met some of the locals,
          and then set off for the mansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arriving at the mansion after a few hours' walk, they split up to enter the garden inside the house's walls.
          Dripp entered through the crumbling parts of the wall, while Reese went in through the gates.
          Near the gates were four Giant Weasels, who attacked the party. Abraham was downed briefly, and tried to drag Reese back to their lair.
          After dispatching the weasels, the party rested for a bit, then proceeded in through the back door of the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, the party explored the kitchen, and found tracks leading through to the next room.
          There, they found a set of stairs. Stepping on the top stair triggered "hideous screams — as if of a soul in torment"
          to rise from the area below, scaring Reese for a time. Down those stairs, they discovered a wine cellar with a dead body,
          and were attacked by two Swarms of Rot Grubs. Once the grubs were dealt with,
          they took a suit of <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/plate">Plate Armour</a>, a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/longsword" class="loot">Longsword</a>, a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/shield" class="loot">Shield</a>, and an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/explorers-pack" class="loot">Explorer's Pack</a> from the corpse,
          as well as a single <span class="loot" title="Worth 50gp, its label bears &quot;the image of a jauntily dressed unicorn&quot;">bottle of rare wine</span> which had rolled under the wine racks.
          then took another rest before following the tracks into another room.
        </p>
        <p>
          This room had a large table, cooking stove, and a series of ten beds. Each bed had a footlocker at the base, bearing 7gp15sp, yielding total cash worth <span class="loot">85gp</span>.
          One door led out of this room to the East, one North, and a trapdoor back upwards to the West wing of the mansion.
          Before checking the other doors, the party tried the trapdoor. On approach, they heard a loud and malevolent voice yell "Welcome, fools — welcome to your deaths!"" Booming, fiendish laughter followed the spoken message.
          This time, it was Abraham who was mortally terrified and unable to calm himself for some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          After checking that the immediate upstairs room was empty, they went back down, and checked the non-barred door that headed North.
          This door led to a bedroom with a much nicer bed.
          Investigating that room yielded
          <ul>
            <li>An <span class="loot">oilskin coat</span> (Worth 5gp. Is fancy, floor-length, with a hood, and trimmed in iridescent green silk)</li>
            <li>A <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/lantern-bullseye">bullseye lantern</a></li>
            <li>Twelve <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/candle">candles</a></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">flint and steel</span></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">parchment, detailing some sort of signaling system</span></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">volume of erotic poetry</span>, fully illustrated</li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">naval almanac</span> listing tide times for the area of coast around Saltmarsh (a total of one hundred miles of coastline is covered)</li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">treatise</span> concerning the demigod Iuz and its minions</li>
          </ul>
          The third book contained a <span class="loot">piece of parchment</span>, with some words/phrases in Common, next to words/phrases in another language, which the party didn't recognize, but which uses the Dwarvish alphabet.
          Further search of the desk in this room also yielded a <span class="loot", title="If you want the list, any non-wizard can spend a few hours studying it to work out what spells are inside.">wizard's spellbook</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not wanting to pass through the door marked Danger quite yet, the party retreated upstairs, and searched through the remaining rooms.
          The rooms in the West wing were searched. The first room contained three books which were damaged a bit, but still worth 7gp each:
          <ul class="loot">
            <li><em>The Magical Properties of Gemstones</em> by the archmage Tenser</li>
            <li><em>The Magical Properties of Herbs and Flowers</em> by the archmage Tenser</li>
            <li><em>The Metaphysics of Mathematics</em> by the mage Nystul</li>
          </ul>
          The third book had <span class="loot>"a note</span> inside. It was illegible from water damage, except the last two words, written in Common, "beyond skeletons." with no other details discernible.
          The last room in the West wing of the ground floor had a beaten-up desk, with a potion in a secret compartment, that contains <span class="loot">two doses of Potion of Healing</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, the party cautiously proceeded to the East wing, where they found two largely empty rooms. The first had <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/blue-quartz">two cut pieces of blue quartz</a>, and the second had nothing but plaster dust on the floor, indicating that the room upstairs has weak floors.
          Lastly, they explored the two rooms they'd so-far left unexplored in the North wing. One was empty, and upon entering the other and approaching the fireplace within, the party were swarmed by spiders.
        </p>
      </div>

        Session 2
      </summary>
      <p>
        The battle with the spiders resulted in Abe going down briefly,
        but his allies were able to keep him in the fight by feeding him some of his newly-acquired healing potion,
        and the spiders were killed.
        A loose brick in the fireplace chimney was removed,
        revealing a small wooden box with <span class="loot">30cp</span> and
        <span class="loot" title="5gp each">two small pouches of alchemical powders</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heading upstairs, the party found that the rooms of the North wing were largely empty.
        The only notable thing was a small pile of clean clothes, in a room otherwise full of moldy laundry.
        On their way to the East wing, S.A.M. barely jumped out of the way as part of the entry room's balcony fell apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jumping across the bad section of the balcony, the party headed to the East wing.
        There, they encountered Ned, a bound and gagged man with a lump on his head, who claimed to be a traveler,
        who'd entered the house the night before, looking for somewhere to sleep.
        Ned was assisted with getting back his clothes from the North wing, and Dripp escorted him out to the camp outside the front gates, where the party had rested earlier.
        Ned took this opportunity to ambush Dripp, but was ultimately easily dispatched after a running fight through the house.
        The only worthwhile thing the party took from Ned was a single <span class="loot">shortsword</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party stopped for an hour to rest, and during this rest, Abraham was able to build some makeshift stairs up to the attic.
        There, the party discovered half a dozen Stirges nesting in the rafters.
        The stirges went down quickly, and searching through the detritus of the attic turned up a porcelain doll costumed to look like a sailor.
        The doll’s eyes were made from two <span class="loot" title="10gp each">small pieces of jade</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all this, the party decided to head back to town to rest for a night.
        Everyone headed to the Snapping Line for some stew.
        S.A.M. and Reese tried the Claw Wine, a local specialty, and Abraham swapped tall tales with some of the local sailors and fishermen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waking up at the crack of dawn the next morning, the party each spent a bit of time getting ready before heading out.
        Dripp read the treatise on Iuz, Reese went to Winston's Store for some more flasks of oil,
        and S.A.M. and Abraham went to The Dwarven Anvil to sell some of their stuff, and get the dents hammered out of S.A.M.'s new armour.
        S.A.M. had an interesting interaction with the owner, Mafera, and got his armour most of the way flattened out.
      </p>
      <p>
        After two uneventful hours on the road, the party arrived at the Haunted House once more, around 8:30AM.
        They proceeded to the still-unexplored West wing of the upper floor. The only notable thing there was <span class="loot" title="No cash value. It is &quot;tooled with a design of coiling ivy leaves&quot;.">a ragged, stained cloak</span>,
        which contained spores of Yellow Mold, nearly killing Dripp. After S.A.M. helped them recover, the party headed back downstairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        On their way back downstairs, the party were much more quiet, and managed to catch one of the bandits who seem to have been living here.
        The bandit fled through a secret door, but was shot and killed just as he went through.
        After dispatching him, the party searched the again-closed fancy bedroom, and there they fought a tall man with a shaved head and piercing green eyes.
        From him, they gathered <span class="loot" title="A long, delicate wooden pipe, which features a bowl made from smooth river stone.">a smoking pipe</span> and <span class="loot" title="20gp value. Masterfully crafted, and also loaded.">a set of gaming dice</span>
        Reese and Dripp scouted ahead, followed by S.A.M. and Abraham, but once the path led to a fork in some natural caves, they retreated back to the main cellar, to tackle the barred door.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the barred door were half a dozen skeletons, covered in some sort of alchemical reagent.
        During the fight, a glowing light came from the seam of a door in the other corner of the room.
        After about one round of fighting, the party managed to close and re-bar the door.
        They poured out some of Reese's new oil flasks, then opened the door and used Dripp's magic to ignite the oil once one of the skeletons had stepped onto it.
        This helped them overcome the damage resistance that the skeletons possessed,
        but there were two complications. First, Abe went down again. Second, there was now an additional skeleton present; Caspar himself!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Skeletal Alchemist lobbed acid at the party, and goaded the other skeletons forward into the flames to try to defeat the party, but proved quite ineffective.
        Abraham, however, had had more than enough of being knocked out in fights. He dragged himself back to consciousness, rose to his feet, sprinted into the room, and finished Caspar off with his sword.
        With Caspar dead once again, the party looted his body, and were able to pass into the next room, where they looted Caspar's alchemy lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loot from Caspar and his lab:
        <ul>
          <li>A <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/bag-of-holding">Bag of Holding</a></li>
