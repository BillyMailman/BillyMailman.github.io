        Session 1
      </summary>
      <div>
        <p>
          Our four intrepid adventurers, Abraham, Dripp, Reese, and S.A.M., met up on the docks of Saltmarsh,
          and agreed to work together to explore the abandoned and haunted home of Caspar Stiobhard.
          After hearing an old poacher's tales of a horde of ghosts, they did some shopping, met some of the locals,
          and then set off for the mansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arriving at the mansion after a few hours' walk, they split up to enter the garden inside the house's walls.
          Dripp entered through the crumbling parts of the wall, while Reese went in through the gates.
          Near the gates were four Giant Weasels, who attacked the party. Abraham was downed briefly, and tried to drag Reese back to their lair.
          After dispatching the weasels, the party rested for a bit, then proceeded in through the back door of the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, the party explored the kitchen, and found tracks leading through to the next room.
          There, they found a set of stairs. Stepping on the top stair triggered "hideous screams — as if of a soul in torment"
          to rise from the area below, scaring Reese for a time. Down those stairs, they discovered a wine cellar with a dead body,
          and were attacked by two Swarms of Rot Grubs. Once the grubs were dealt with,
          they took a suit of <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/plate">Plate Armour</a>, a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/longsword" class="loot">Longsword</a>, a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/shield" class="loot">Shield</a>, and an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/explorers-pack" class="loot">Explorer's Pack</a> from the corpse,
          as well as a single <span class="loot" title="Worth 50gp, its label bears &quot;the image of a jauntily dressed unicorn&quot;">bottle of rare wine</span> which had rolled under the wine racks.
          then took another rest before following the tracks into another room.
        </p>
        <p>
          This room had a large table, cooking stove, and a series of ten beds. Each bed had a footlocker at the base, bearing 7gp15sp, yielding total cash worth <span class="loot">85gp</span>.
          One door led out of this room to the East, one North, and a trapdoor back upwards to the West wing of the mansion.
          Before checking the other doors, the party tried the trapdoor. On approach, they heard a loud and malevolent voice yell "Welcome, fools — welcome to your deaths!"" Booming, fiendish laughter followed the spoken message.
          This time, it was Abraham who was mortally terrified and unable to calm himself for some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          After checking that the immediate upstairs room was empty, they went back down, and checked the non-barred door that headed North.
          This door led to a bedroom with a much nicer bed.
          Investigating that room yielded
          <ul>
            <li>An <span class="loot">oilskin coat</span> (Worth 5gp. Is fancy, floor-length, with a hood, and trimmed in iridescent green silk)</li>
            <li>A <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/lantern-bullseye">bullseye lantern</a></li>
            <li>Twelve <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/candle">candles</a></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">flint and steel</span></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">parchment, detailing some sort of signaling system</span></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">volume of erotic poetry</span>, fully illustrated</li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">naval almanac</span> listing tide times for the area of coast around Saltmarsh (a total of one hundred miles of coastline is covered)</li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">treatise</span> concerning the demigod Iuz and its minions</li>
          </ul>
          The third book contained a <span class="loot">piece of parchment</span>, with some words/phrases in Common, next to words/phrases in another language, which the party didn't recognize, but which uses the Dwarvish alphabet.
          Further search of the desk in this room also yielded a <span class="loot", title="If you want the list, any non-wizard can spend a few hours studying it to work out what spells are inside.">wizard's spellbook</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not wanting to pass through the door marked Danger quite yet, the party retreated upstairs, and searched through the remaining rooms.
          The rooms in the West wing were searched. The first room contained three books which were damaged a bit, but still worth 7gp each:
          <ul class="loot">
            <li><em>The Magical Properties of Gemstones</em> by the archmage Tenser</li>
            <li><em>The Magical Properties of Herbs and Flowers</em> by the archmage Tenser</li>
            <li><em>The Metaphysics of Mathematics</em> by the mage Nystul</li>
          </ul>
          The third book had <span class="loot>"a note</span> inside. It was illegible from water damage, except the last two words, written in Common, "beyond skeletons." with no other details discernible.
          The last room in the West wing of the ground floor had a beaten-up desk, with a potion in a secret compartment, that contains <span class="loot">two doses of Potion of Healing</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, the party cautiously proceeded to the East wing, where they found two largely empty rooms. The first had <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/blue-quartz">two cut pieces of blue quartz</a>, and the second had nothing but plaster dust on the floor, indicating that the room upstairs has weak floors.
          Lastly, they explored the two rooms they'd so-far left unexplored in the North wing. One was empty, and upon entering the other and approaching the fireplace within, the party were swarmed by spiders.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>
        Session 2
      </summary>
      <p>
        The battle with the spiders resulted in Abe going down briefly,
        but his allies were able to keep him in the fight by feeding him some of his newly-acquired healing potion,
        and the spiders were killed.
        A loose brick in the fireplace chimney was removed,
        revealing a small wooden box with <span class="loot">30cp</span> and
        <span class="loot" title="5gp each">two small pouches of alchemical powders</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heading upstairs, the party found that the rooms of the North wing were largely empty.
        The only notable thing was a small pile of clean clothes, in a room otherwise full of moldy laundry.
        On their way to the East wing, S.A.M. barely jumped out of the way as part of the entry room's balcony fell apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jumping across the bad section of the balcony, the party headed to the East wing.
        There, they encountered Ned, a bound and gagged man with a lump on his head, who claimed to be a traveler,
        who'd entered the house the night before, looking for somewhere to sleep.
        Ned was assisted with getting back his clothes from the North wing, and Dripp escorted him out to the camp outside the front gates, where the party had rested earlier.
        Ned took this opportunity to ambush Dripp, but was ultimately easily dispatched after a running fight through the house.
        The only worthwhile thing the party took from Ned was a single <span class="loot">shortsword</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party stopped for an hour to rest, and during this rest, Abraham was able to build some makeshift stairs up to the attic.
        There, the party discovered half a dozen Stirges nesting in the rafters.
        The stirges went down quickly, and searching through the detritus of the attic turned up a porcelain doll costumed to look like a sailor.
        The doll’s eyes were made from two <span class="loot" title="10gp each">small pieces of jade</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all this, the party decided to head back to town to rest for a night.
        Everyone headed to the Snapping Line for some stew.
        S.A.M. and Reese tried the Claw Wine, a local specialty, and Abraham swapped tall tales with some of the local sailors and fishermen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waking up at the crack of dawn the next morning, the party each spent a bit of time getting ready before heading out.
        Dripp read the treatise on Iuz, Reese went to Winston's Store for some more flasks of oil,
        and S.A.M. and Abraham went to The Dwarven Anvil to sell some of their stuff, and get the dents hammered out of S.A.M.'s new armour.
        S.A.M. had an interesting interaction with the owner, Mafera, and got his armour most of the way flattened out.
      </p>
      <p>
        After two uneventful hours on the road, the party arrived at the Haunted House once more, around 8:30AM.
        They proceeded to the still-unexplored West wing of the upper floor. The only notable thing there was <span class="loot" title="No cash value. It is &quot;tooled with a design of coiling ivy leaves&quot;.">a ragged, stained cloak</span>,
        which contained spores of Yellow Mold, nearly killing Dripp. After S.A.M. helped them recover, the party headed back downstairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        On their way back downstairs, the party were much more quiet, and managed to catch one of the bandits who seem to have been living here.
        The bandit fled through a secret door, but was shot and killed just as he went through.
        After dispatching him, the party searched the again-closed fancy bedroom, and there they fought a tall man with a shaved head and piercing green eyes.
        From him, they gathered <span class="loot" title="A long, delicate wooden pipe, which features a bowl made from smooth river stone.">a smoking pipe</span> and <span class="loot" title="20gp value. Masterfully crafted, and also loaded.">a set of gaming dice</span>
        Reese and Dripp scouted ahead, followed by S.A.M. and Abraham, but once the path led to a fork in some natural caves, they retreated back to the main cellar, to tackle the barred door.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the barred door were half a dozen skeletons, covered in some sort of alchemical reagent.
        During the fight, a glowing light came from the seam of a door in the other corner of the room.
        After about one round of fighting, the party managed to close and re-bar the door.
        They poured out some of Reese's new oil flasks, then opened the door and used Dripp's magic to ignite the oil once one of the skeletons had stepped onto it.
        This helped them overcome the damage resistance that the skeletons possessed,
        but there were two complications. First, Abe went down again. Second, there was now an additional skeleton present; Caspar himself!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Skeletal Alchemist lobbed acid at the party, and goaded the other skeletons forward into the flames to try to defeat the party, but proved quite ineffective.
        Abraham, however, had had more than enough of being knocked out in fights. He dragged himself back to consciousness, rose to his feet, sprinted into the room, and finished Caspar off with his sword.
        With Caspar dead once again, the party looted his body, and were able to pass into the next room, where they looted Caspar's alchemy lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loot from Caspar and his lab:
        <ul>
          <li>A <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/bag-of-holding">Bag of Holding</a></li>
          <li>A <span class="loot">flat, gray-and-black river stone, inscribed with an unknown arcane symbol. It feels cool to the touch.</span></li>
          <li>A <span class="loot" title="50gp value. Will take time if you want to study it.">Book</span>, titled <em>Ye Secret of Ye Philosopher’s Stone</em>. No author is listed.</li>
          <li>A <span class="loot" title="20gp">human skull made of gold</span></li>
          <li>An <span class="loot" title="5gp">apple made of gold</span></li>
          <li>A <span class="loot" title="5gp">rose made of gold</span></li>
          <li>A <span class="loot" title="5gp total">set of five small balance weights made of gold</span></li>
          <li><span class="loot">47gp</span></li>
          <li><span class="loot">A spellbook</span></li>
          <li><span class="loot" title="20gp">Alchemical Apparatus</span>, similar to what would be in Alchemist's Supplies</li>

        </ul>

        Session 3
      </summary>
      <p>
        Having looted Caspar's lab, the party rested for a bit, to heal.
        Reese identified the stone, and Abe identified the Pipe.
        Proceeding into the caves, they encountered a small group of scouts.
        Combat with the scouts was deadly, and Abe and S.A.M. both nearly died.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party retreated to Caspar's lab to wait for their near-dead members to recover.
        When they emerged, they found that the smugglers had largely left, with only two hobgoblins remaining.
        The hobgoblins were bribed into leaving, and the party were then free to capture the silks and brandy contraband in the area, put it on the smugglers' own boat, and sail it all to Saltmarsh.
      </p>
      <p>
        On returning to Saltmarsh, the party were questioned by Eliander Fireborn, the captain of the town guard.
        He dispatched guards to check their story, and while waiting for him to release them, the party reached level 2.
        On his return, the party were released with a <span class="loot">200gp</span> reward.
      </p>
      <p>
        This led to the party's first real chance to take some time for themselves:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Dripp took the opportunity to try to befriend Captain Xendros, making plans to get together and drink on Friday. They then visited Krag, the town gravedigger, asking about the possibility of acquiring Caspar's house.
            <ul>
              <li>-2gp for Modest lifestyle Monday/Tuesday.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese did some shopping, and set about getting some training in Herbalism.
            <ul>
              <li>-2gp for Modest lifestyle Monday/Tuesday. -16gp for training. 2/21 days of training complete.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            S.A.M. set about cleaning up the Moradin shrine at the blacksmith's.
            <ul>
              <li>-2gp for Modest lifestyle Monday/Tuesday. The shrine is now cleaned up and re-sanctified.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Abraham found work as a carpenter.
            <ul>
              <li>-2gp for Modest lifestyle Monday/Tuesday. +10gp for working those days as a carpenter.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Downtime was, however, interrupted. On Wednesday morning, a man approached Reese and Dripp at the Wicker Goat.
        He introduced himself as Slate, and explained that he was a statue brought to life by Caspar during one of his many experiments, twenty-five years ago.
        He was dying, and needed the party's help securing enough money to ensure his family were okay.
        They ventured up the shore with him, to kill One-Eyed Sally, a giant octopus whose ink he needed for water-breathing potions.
        With Sally and her ambush-happy mate slain, the party stopped for a short calamari lunch, while Slate headed back to town.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the potions ready, Slate took the party out on his fishing boat to a shipwreck, <em>The Moon</em>, which he knew to contain a large quantity of silver.
        The party swam down into the shipwreck, found their way into the hold, and found the chest with the silver.
        On touching the chest, several shadows emerged from the skeletons of the original crew, and attacked the party, slamming shut the door, and cutting them off from each other.
        The door was bashed in, and the shadows dispatched, with Dripp significantly weakened by the ordeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        On returning to the surface with the silver, the party discovered Slate had passed on, turning back into his original stone.
        With the silver secured, the party decided to return to the wreck while the waterbreathing potions still lasted, and ran into a group of reef sharks.
        The sharks approached the party, who prepared for battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loot:
        <ul>
          <li>Caspar's strange river stone was identified as a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/cursed-luckstone" class="loot">Cursed Luckstone</a>.</li>
          <li>The wizard's pipe was identified as a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/pipe-of-remembrance" class="loot">Pipe of Remembrance</a>.</li>
          <li>The wizard's spellbook was found to contain <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm-person">Charm Person</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/color-spray">Colour Spray</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile">Magic Missile</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silent-image">Silent Image</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-mouth">Magic Mouth</a>, and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scorching-ray">Scorching Ray</a>.</li>

          <li>The party earned the above-mentioned 200gp reward, and also got <span class="loot">250gp</span> worth of silver ingots.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">

        Session 4
      </summary>
      <p>
        The party finished dealing with the reef sharks, with S.A.M. nearly dying at one point,
        and then scoured the rest of the wreck of <em>The Moon</em>.
        Nothing further was found, so they returned to Slate's family, and informed them of his fate.
        Pledging to find a way to return Slate to life, they turned over half the silver, splitting the rest between themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        That evening, Abe recieved a letter from his order, and S.A.M. had a vision from his god.
        S.A.M. set out to put this vision into motion, and Abe set off to visit the town druid, Ferrin Kastilar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next few days, the party spent on downtime:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abraham spent Thursday through Saturday working for Krag, helping to manage his and Eliander's library,
            in exchange for Krag helping him to research "organizations other than Abe's own that work with/against Fiends or Undead".
            <ul>
              <li>-1gp for Modest lifestyle Wednesday.</li>
              <li>3/7 days of helping Krag completed.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Dripp continued trying to befriend everyone in town.
            <ul>
              <li>-4gp for Modest lifestyle Wednesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese spent three more days in training.
            <ul>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            S.A.M. spent three days working on spreading the word of Moradin to the faithful, and getting supplies that would be needed to get the shrine re-sanctified as part of a proper temple.
            <ul>
              <li>-4gp for Modest lifestyle Wednesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        On Saturday morning, the party were all approached by messengers, summoning them to the Town Council's chambers.
        There, they met the five members of the Town Council, and were hired for a job.
        They were promised <span>400gp</span> upon return if they would assault the ship that had been working with the smugglers,
        'deal' with everyone aboard, and secure any contraband.
        The standard bounty would be paid out for the contraband, and anything else the smugglers had with them would be considered 'salvage'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party agreed, and that night, they were escorted to Caspar's home by two members of the town guard.
        They waited through the night, with Abe doing his best to repair some of the broken-down parts of the house.
        Eventually, they saw the signal from the ship, sent the return, and then rowed their way out to the <em>Sea Ghost</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boarding the ship, they were able to bluff their way on, and avoided letting the crew alert the officers right away.
        However, when they opened the door to one of the rooms on the top deck, they alerted the captain, who yelled out.
        The captain and a wizard were quickly dispatched, allowing the party to clear out their rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, the party proceeded towards the bow of the main deck, encountering a group of lizardfolk.
        The lizardfolk were hesitant to talk, but also didn't quite seem willing to attack the party, either.
        After some discussion, the party left the lizardfolk, and cleared out the rest of the main deck without problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party now started to explore the lower deck, working their way from prow to stern.
        First, they encountered five sleeping bandits.
        Reese attempted to steal the bandits' weapons before they awoke, but the noise started to wake them up.
        He was able to kill one bandit before she woke up properly, and then the party dispatched the rest of the bandits fairly easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, they checked the main hold, which held only casks and bolts of silk.
        After that, they proceeded to the officers' quarters on the lower deck.
        In one room, they faced off against the swashbuckling first mate, and in the other, they dealt with the deadly hook-handed Bosun, who had emerged into his room from a secret door.
        Having dispatched these two officers, the party prepared to head into the door, and see what lied beyond.

        Session 5
      </summary>
      <p>
        Opening the secret door aboard the Sea Ghost, the party met a sea elf.
        After some communication issues, he introduced himself to Dripp as Oceanus, and explained that he was from a sea elf tribe not far from Saltmarsh,
        and that he had been sent to investigate the Sea Ghost, as his people were curious what it was doing.
        While sneaking aboard, he was caught and imprisoned, and now he offered to help the party clear out any remaining pirates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearing out the rest of the ship, the party found Oceanus' confiscated weapons, <span class="loot">200 sp</span>, two <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing" class="loot">Potions of Healing</a>,
        a single dose of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/antitoxin" class="loot">Antitoxin</a>, and a number of <span class="loot">Maps</span>.
        They also found a second secret door, leading to a room with a large cache of weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confident that the ship was cleared of smugglers, the party headed down into the bilges. There, they found mostly trash, rats, and some rot grubs, who were quickly dealt with.
        They called for the two guards who had joined them on the raid. With the guards' help, they were able to get the Sea Ghost moving, and head back to Saltmarsh.
        Once there, they debriefed Eliander at his office, got paid for the job, and reached level 3.
        The party were also given use of the Sea Ghost as their ship, and a crew of eight for a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sea Ghost was promptly renamed Serenity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party then had eight days to themselves, to spend on downtime:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abraham spent four days finishing the work he was doing for Krag. After that, he spent four days doing something undecided that we'll figure out later.
            <ul>
              <li>-4gp for Modest lifestyle Thursday to Sunday.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Dripp spent a day scribing rituals into their new 'spellbook', then spent a week Carousing at the Empty Net. In doing so, they made a friend!
            <ul>
              <li>-8gp for Modest lifestyle Sunday to Sunday.</li>
              <li>-300gp for Scribing inks (Magic Mouth, Tenser's Disk, Comprehend Languages, Skywrite).</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese spent all eight days continuing his training.
            <ul>
              <li>-8gp for Modest lifestyle Sunday to Sunday.</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            S.A.M. spent two more days prepping to have the shrine turned into a proper temple. By talking to some of the local dwarves, and explaining Mafera's story, he got the help he needed.
            He also headed out to the local temple of Procan, and met with the priest there, Wellgar Brinehanded, who told him about Procan.
          </li>
          <li>
            The party also shelled out the money necessary to have Xendros try to get in whatever magic items she could get her hands on.
            The following were made available on Sunday the 23rd of Harvester, and will be available through Saturday the first of Brewfest:

        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        On Monday, S.A.M. was approached by Wellgar, with a request for help.
        A small town up the coast had a fort just up the road which had housed an order of paladins, the Templars of the Trident.
        The templars hadn't been seen for a couple of months, even just to get food and supplies.
        Some of the locals had checked the place out, but some sort of wailing noise had scared them away.
        Since the party had experience with investigating 'hauntings', Wellgar wanted to know if they would take a look into it.
        The party agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sailing out to the small town, the party were ambushed along the way by a group of goblins aboard a flotsam raft-ship of some kind.
        Armed with jellyfish, the goblins were able to poison and electrocute the party.
        Despite several waves being flung up onto the ship, including a boss armed with a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/1457143-jellyfish-whip" class="loot">Jellyfish Whip</a>,
        the party prevailed easily, and dispatched the goblins.
        Salvaging some lumber, and scuttling their ship, the party moved on to the town.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arriving at the town, the party were given instructions to the fort, and headed out.
        The bridge to the fort was rickety and broken, but Abe was able to lash it back into better shape using some of S.A.M.'s spare rope.
        Exploring, the party found a number of abandoned rooms, and stone spiral stairs which were collapsed leading downwards, but intact leading up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upstairs, the party met Serena Alexios, the undead last survivor of the Templars of the Trident.
        Serena explained that her order had been ambushed by Sahuagin, who had summoned some sort of foul devil.
        The Templars had slain the devil, but their numbers were thinned too much, and the Sahuagin had finished them off.
        Several templars had awoken days later, returned to un-life as Revenants.
        A counter-attack against the Sahuagin was mounted, but their priestess had prepared wards against the undead, and the Templars were weakened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only Serena had made it out 'alive'.
        The wards below were now strengthened, and she could not deal with the Sahuagin.
        But she was also bound to the fort by her new undead state, and could not leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Serena asked the party to help her see her duty fulfilled, that she might pass on.
        They agreed, and she offered them each the chance to pledge the oath of her order.
        Abraham, Dripp, and S.A.M. agreed, and recieved a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/other-rewards#Charms" class="loot">Charm of Heroism</a>.
        Serena told the party that if they continued up and around the fort, they would find an approach to the sea caves below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entering the caves, the party were able to separate the sahuagin, taking them out largely one-by-one.
        The priestess had been attempting to open another portal to the Nine Hells, to summon something quite large and nasty.
        But, because the spell was incomplete, Reese and Dripp were able to work together, and un-ravel the incomplete portal.
        As it closed, a single imp came through, but Reese was able to stab it and kill it before it could do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Returning upstairs, the party found that Serena had, in fact, passed on, with a slight smile on her face.
        The party returned to the nearby small town, where they were thanked, and told that the now-empty fort would be turned into a memorial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sailing home, the party had an encounter with some local Flying Fish.
        They were able to capture seven of the fish's wings, which they can craft into a one-time use of the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/color-spray">Colour Spray</a> spell (At first level).

      <p>
        Returning home from their travels, the officers of <em>Serenity</em> told Wellgar of the fate of the Templars,
        the Sahuagin and their portal, and were thanked for their troubles.
        They then spent a week around town, working on various things:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abe headed north to Burle, had a meeting with Castellan Kiara Shadowbreaker, and got a small payout for the smugglers the party'd taken out.
            He then spent the rest of the week participating in a local pit fighting ring, used by some of the local guardsmen, criminals, mercenaries, and such to blow off steam.

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Dripp spent the week performing in the city streets, using cantrips to entertain the town.
            <ul>
              <li>Comfortable lifestyle for a week for free.</li>
            </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, Ferrin approached Reese, asking him to confirm that the party had, indeed, fought sahuagin up the coast.
        When Reese confirmed this, Ferrin explained that he'd conducted a ritual recently, using the power of Celene being full.
        Through that ritual, he'd come to find that the sahuagin were becoming more of a problem overall, in the area.
        He asked if the party might take <em>Serenity</em> to investigate a small group nearby,
        who had taken a number of animals captive, and were charging their kin money to see the animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party agreed, and <em>Serenity</em> headed out, with the officers easily able to approach in the Jolly Boat.
        Inside, they calmed things down with the two sahuagin in the cave, and were able to pay to see the 'animals'.
        The sahuagin toured them around the tide pools, and then tried to shoo the party out, but Dripp had spotted a tunnel underwater in one pool.
        Abraham kicked off a fight, and the two sahuagin were quickly dispatched.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the sahuagin was taken prisoner, and Dripp interrogated them, in hopes of tricking whoever was on the other side of the tunnel.
        That sahuagin was then killed, and the party started scouting through the tunnel.
        Heading through to the other side, they encountered a sahuagin, a sahuagin priestess, and two reef sharks.
        Once the sahuagin were both dead, the surviving shark stopped attacking, and the party were able to free the sea otters and giant octopus that the sahuagin had captured.
        They also got <span class="loot">70gp</span> and a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/driftglobe" class="loot">driftglobe</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>Serenity</em> then returned to town uneventfully, and another week passed without incident
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abe spent another week pit-fighting.
            <ul>

          <li>
            Dripp spent the week doing research on ways to help Slate, but didn't find anything.
            They did, however, meet Oceanus again at Eliander's place, who was there learning Common.
            Their last two days were spent trying to entertain the locals.

        </ul>
        <p>
          At the end of this, the <em>Serenity</em>'s officers were summoned to meet the council.
          They were joined at the meeting by Oceanus and Will Stoutly, who is in charge of Saltmarsh's marines.
          The council explained that the marines had scouted the area the lizardfolk were known to be, and they were asking the party to help deal with that situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eliander thought that the lizardfolk were allies of the Sea Princes, and preparing to attack Saltmarsh.
          The elves of Manaan thought that the lizardfolk were allying with their enemies, and preparing to attack them.
          The rest of the council weren't quite willing to believe Eliander, but were worried he might be right.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>Serenity</em> headed out, with Oceanus aboard, and the party headed to the Lizardfolk Lair.
          Taking Gellan's laughing suggestion to be a good idea, they knocked on the main gate.
          They were taken by guards, stipped of their weapons, and led them to minister, Sauriv.
          He chatted with them a moment, then they were escorted to the throne room, to meet with the queen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The party found that the lizardfolk were gathering allies, and among them were the evil Koalinth!
          The queen sent them out, to try to convince her people, and told them they had only a single day to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between them, the party were able to win over the commoners, guards, shamans, the minister, the queen herself, and the ambassadors of both the Locathah and the Merfolk.
          The Koalinth, meanwhile, left. They had decided they wanted no part in this war.
          Also, the party discovered the truth of the war; the lizardfolk were purchasing weapons from the Sea Princes, but nothing more.
          The war preparations were to defeat sahuagin, who had invaded the lizardfolk's true lair a year before.
          The lizardfolk don't know why, but the sahuagin have managed to sink some of the lower levels of the lair beneath the waves.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Queen Othokent and her people convinced to offer Saltmarsh a position within the alliance, the party reached level 4.
          As well, the queen offered two optional jobs for the party.
          The first, to kill a giant crocodile, Thousand-Teeth The Devourer, who was threatening the tribe.
          The second, to recover a stolen artifact of some kind from some Bullywugs in the swamp nearby.
