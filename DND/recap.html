        Session 1
      </summary>
      <div>
        <p>
          Our four intrepid adventurers, Abraham, Dripp, Reese, and S.A.M., met up on the docks of Saltmarsh,
          and agreed to work together to explore the abandoned and haunted home of Caspar Stiobhard.
          After hearing an old poacher's tales of a horde of ghosts, they did some shopping, met some of the locals,
          and then set off for the mansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arriving at the mansion after a few hours' walk, they split up to enter the garden inside the house's walls.
          Dripp entered through the crumbling parts of the wall, while Reese went in through the gates.
          Near the gates were four Giant Weasels, who attacked the party. Abraham was downed briefly, and tried to drag Reese back to their lair.
          After dispatching the weasels, the party rested for a bit, then proceeded in through the back door of the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, the party explored the kitchen, and found tracks leading through to the next room.
          There, they found a set of stairs. Stepping on the top stair triggered "hideous screams — as if of a soul in torment"
          to rise from the area below, scaring Reese for a time. Down those stairs, they discovered a wine cellar with a dead body,
          and were attacked by two Swarms of Rot Grubs. Once the grubs were dealt with,
          they took a suit of <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/plate">Plate Armour</a>, a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/longsword" class="loot">Longsword</a>, a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/shield" class="loot">Shield</a>, and an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/explorers-pack" class="loot">Explorer's Pack</a> from the corpse,
          as well as a single <span class="loot" title="Worth 50gp, its label bears &quot;the image of a jauntily dressed unicorn&quot;">bottle of rare wine</span> which had rolled under the wine racks.
          then took another rest before following the tracks into another room.
        </p>
        <p>
          This room had a large table, cooking stove, and a series of ten beds. Each bed had a footlocker at the base, bearing 7gp15sp, yielding total cash worth <span class="loot">85gp</span>.
          One door led out of this room to the East, one North, and a trapdoor back upwards to the West wing of the mansion.
          Before checking the other doors, the party tried the trapdoor. On approach, they heard a loud and malevolent voice yell "Welcome, fools — welcome to your deaths!"" Booming, fiendish laughter followed the spoken message.
          This time, it was Abraham who was mortally terrified and unable to calm himself for some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          After checking that the immediate upstairs room was empty, they went back down, and checked the non-barred door that headed North.
          This door led to a bedroom with a much nicer bed.
          Investigating that room yielded
          <ul>
            <li>An <span class="loot">oilskin coat</span> (Worth 5gp. Is fancy, floor-length, with a hood, and trimmed in iridescent green silk)</li>
            <li>A <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/lantern-bullseye">bullseye lantern</a></li>
            <li>Twelve <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/candle">candles</a></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">flint and steel</span></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">parchment, detailing some sort of signaling system</span></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">volume of erotic poetry</span>, fully illustrated</li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">naval almanac</span> listing tide times for the area of coast around Saltmarsh (a total of one hundred miles of coastline is covered)</li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">treatise</span> concerning the demigod Iuz and its minions</li>
          </ul>
          The third book contained a <span class="loot">piece of parchment</span>, with some words/phrases in Common, next to words/phrases in another language, which the party didn't recognize, but which uses the Dwarvish alphabet.
          Further search of the desk in this room also yielded a <span class="loot", title="If you want the list, any non-wizard can spend a few hours studying it to work out what spells are inside.">wizard's spellbook</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not wanting to pass through the door marked Danger quite yet, the party retreated upstairs, and searched through the remaining rooms.
          The rooms in the West wing were searched. The first room contained three books which were damaged a bit, but still worth 7gp each:
          <ul class="loot">
            <li><em>The Magical Properties of Gemstones</em> by the archmage Tenser</li>
            <li><em>The Magical Properties of Herbs and Flowers</em> by the archmage Tenser</li>
            <li><em>The Metaphysics of Mathematics</em> by the mage Nystul</li>
          </ul>
          The third book had <span class="loot>"a note</span> inside. It was illegible from water damage, except the last two words, written in Common, "beyond skeletons." with no other details discernible.
          The last room in the West wing of the ground floor had a beaten-up desk, with a potion in a secret compartment, that contains <span class="loot">two doses of Potion of Healing</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, the party cautiously proceeded to the East wing, where they found two largely empty rooms. The first had <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/blue-quartz">two cut pieces of blue quartz</a>, and the second had nothing but plaster dust on the floor, indicating that the room upstairs has weak floors.
          Lastly, they explored the two rooms they'd so-far left unexplored in the North wing. One was empty, and upon entering the other and approaching the fireplace within, the party were swarmed by spiders.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>
        Session 2
      </summary>
      <p>
        The battle with the spiders resulted in Abe going down briefly,
        but his allies were able to keep him in the fight by feeding him some of his newly-acquired healing potion,
        and the spiders were killed.
        A loose brick in the fireplace chimney was removed,
        revealing a small wooden box with <span class="loot">30cp</span> and
        <span class="loot" title="5gp each">two small pouches of alchemical powders</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heading upstairs, the party found that the rooms of the North wing were largely empty.
        The only notable thing was a small pile of clean clothes, in a room otherwise full of moldy laundry.
        On their way to the East wing, S.A.M. barely jumped out of the way as part of the entry room's balcony fell apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jumping across the bad section of the balcony, the party headed to the East wing.
        There, they encountered Ned, a bound and gagged man with a lump on his head, who claimed to be a traveler,
        who'd entered the house the night before, looking for somewhere to sleep.
        Ned was assisted with getting back his clothes from the North wing, and Dripp escorted him out to the camp outside the front gates, where the party had rested earlier.
        Ned took this opportunity to ambush Dripp, but was ultimately easily dispatched after a running fight through the house.
        The only worthwhile thing the party took from Ned was a single <span class="loot">shortsword</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party stopped for an hour to rest, and during this rest, Abraham was able to build some makeshift stairs up to the attic.
        There, the party discovered half a dozen Stirges nesting in the rafters.
        The stirges went down quickly, and searching through the detritus of the attic turned up a porcelain doll costumed to look like a sailor.
        The doll’s eyes were made from two <span class="loot" title="10gp each">small pieces of jade</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all this, the party decided to head back to town to rest for a night.
        Everyone headed to the Snapping Line for some stew.
        S.A.M. and Reese tried the Claw Wine, a local specialty, and Abraham swapped tall tales with some of the local sailors and fishermen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waking up at the crack of dawn the next morning, the party each spent a bit of time getting ready before heading out.
        Dripp read the treatise on Iuz, Reese went to Winston's Store for some more flasks of oil,
        and S.A.M. and Abraham went to The Dwarven Anvil to sell some of their stuff, and get the dents hammered out of S.A.M.'s new armour.
        S.A.M. had an interesting interaction with the owner, Mafera, and got his armour most of the way flattened out.
      </p>
      <p>
        After two uneventful hours on the road, the party arrived at the Haunted House once more, around 8:30AM.
        They proceeded to the still-unexplored West wing of the upper floor. The only notable thing there was <span class="loot" title="No cash value. It is &quot;tooled with a design of coiling ivy leaves&quot;.">a ragged, stained cloak</span>,
        which contained spores of Yellow Mold, nearly killing Dripp. After S.A.M. helped them recover, the party headed back downstairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        On their way back downstairs, the party were much more quiet, and managed to catch one of the bandits who seem to have been living here.
        The bandit fled through a secret door, but was shot and killed just as he went through.
        After dispatching him, the party searched the again-closed fancy bedroom, and there they fought a tall man with a shaved head and piercing green eyes.
        From him, they gathered <span class="loot" title="A long, delicate wooden pipe, which features a bowl made from smooth river stone.">a smoking pipe</span> and <span class="loot" title="20gp value. Masterfully crafted, and also loaded.">a set of gaming dice</span>
        Reese and Dripp scouted ahead, followed by S.A.M. and Abraham, but once the path led to a fork in some natural caves, they retreated back to the main cellar, to tackle the barred door.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the barred door were half a dozen skeletons, covered in some sort of alchemical reagent.
        During the fight, a glowing light came from the seam of a door in the other corner of the room.
        After about one round of fighting, the party managed to close and re-bar the door.
        They poured out some of Reese's new oil flasks, then opened the door and used Dripp's magic to ignite the oil once one of the skeletons had stepped onto it.
        This helped them overcome the damage resistance that the skeletons possessed,
        but there were two complications. First, Abe went down again. Second, there was now an additional skeleton present; Caspar himself!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Skeletal Alchemist lobbed acid at the party, and goaded the other skeletons forward into the flames to try to defeat the party, but proved quite ineffective.
        Abraham, however, had had more than enough of being knocked out in fights. He dragged himself back to consciousness, rose to his feet, sprinted into the room, and finished Caspar off with his sword.
        With Caspar dead once again, the party looted his body, and were able to pass into the next room, where they looted Caspar's alchemy lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loot from Caspar and his lab:
        <ul>
          <li>A <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/bag-of-holding">Bag of Holding</a></li>
          <li>A <span class="loot">flat, gray-and-black river stone, inscribed with an unknown arcane symbol. It feels cool to the touch.</span></li>
          <li>A <span class="loot" title="50gp value. Will take time if you want to study it.">Book</span>, titled <em>Ye Secret of Ye Philosopher’s Stone</em>. No author is listed.</li>
          <li>A <span class="loot" title="20gp">human skull made of gold</span></li>
          <li>An <span class="loot" title="5gp">apple made of gold</span></li>
          <li>A <span class="loot" title="5gp">rose made of gold</span></li>
          <li>A <span class="loot" title="5gp total">set of five small balance weights made of gold</span></li>
          <li><span class="loot">47gp</span></li>
          <li><span class="loot">A spellbook</span></li>
          <li><span class="loot" title="20gp">Alchemical Apparatus</span>, similar to what would be in Alchemist's Supplies</li>
          <li>The <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/-rPX9Up4" class="loot">Alchemical Recipes</a> for Tanglefoot Bags and Thunderstones.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        Session 3
      </summary>
      <p>
        Having looted Caspar's lab, the party rested for a bit, to heal.
        Reese identified the stone, and Abe identified the Pipe.
        Proceeding into the caves, they encountered a small group of scouts.
        Combat with the scouts was deadly, and Abe and S.A.M. both nearly died.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party retreated to Caspar's lab to wait for their near-dead members to recover.
        When they emerged, they found that the smugglers had largely left, with only two hobgoblins remaining.
        The hobgoblins were bribed into leaving, and the party were then free to capture the silks and brandy contraband in the area, put it on the smugglers' own boat, and sail it all to Saltmarsh.
      </p>
      <p>
        On returning to Saltmarsh, the party were questioned by Eliander Fireborn, the captain of the town guard.
        He dispatched guards to check their story, and while waiting for him to release them, the party reached level 2.
        On his return, the party were released with a <span class="loot">200gp</span> reward.
      </p>
      <p>
        This led to the party's first real chance to take some time for themselves:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abraham found work as a carpenter.
            <ul>
              <li>-2gp for Modest lifestyle Monday/Tuesday. +10gp for working those days as a carpenter.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Dripp took the opportunity to try to befriend Captain Xendros, making plans to get together and drink on Friday. They then visited Krag, the town gravedigger, asking about the possibility of acquiring Caspar's house.
            <ul>
              <li>-2gp for Modest lifestyle Monday/Tuesday.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese did some shopping, and set about getting some training in Herbalism.
            <ul>
              <li>-2gp for Modest lifestyle Monday/Tuesday. -16gp for training. 2/21 days of training complete.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            S.A.M. set about cleaning up the Moradin shrine at the blacksmith's.
            <ul>
              <li>-2gp for Modest lifestyle Monday/Tuesday. The shrine is now cleaned up and re-sanctified.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Downtime was, however, interrupted. On Wednesday morning, a man approached Reese and Dripp at the Wicker Goat.
        He introduced himself as Slate, and explained that he was a statue brought to life by Caspar during one of his many experiments, twenty-five years ago.
        He was dying, and needed the party's help securing enough money to ensure his family were okay.
        They ventured up the shore with him, to kill One-Eyed Sally, a giant octopus whose ink he needed for water-breathing potions.
        With Sally and her ambush-happy mate slain, the party stopped for a short calamari lunch, while Slate headed back to town.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the potions ready, Slate took the party out on his fishing boat to a shipwreck, <em>The Moon</em>, which he knew to contain a large quantity of silver.
        The party swam down into the shipwreck, found their way into the hold, and found the chest with the silver.
        On touching the chest, several shadows emerged from the skeletons of the original crew, and attacked the party, slamming shut the door, and cutting them off from each other.
        The door was bashed in, and the shadows dispatched, with Dripp significantly weakened by the ordeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        On returning to the surface with the silver, the party discovered Slate had passed on, turning back into his original stone.
        With the silver secured, the party decided to return to the wreck while the waterbreathing potions still lasted, and ran into a group of reef sharks.
        The sharks approached the party, who prepared for battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loot:
        <ul>
          <li>Caspar's strange river stone was identified as a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/cursed-luckstone" class="loot">Cursed Luckstone</a>.</li>
          <li>The wizard's pipe was identified as a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/pipe-of-remembrance" class="loot">Pipe of Remembrance</a>.</li>
          <li>The wizard's spellbook was found to contain <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm-person">Charm Person</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/color-spray">Colour Spray</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile">Magic Missile</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silent-image">Silent Image</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-mouth">Magic Mouth</a>, and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scorching-ray">Scorching Ray</a>.</li>

          <li>The party earned the above-mentioned 200gp reward, and also got <span class="loot">250gp</span> worth of silver ingots.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">

        Session 4
      </summary>
      <p>
        The party finished dealing with the reef sharks, with S.A.M. nearly dying at one point,
        and then scoured the rest of the wreck of <em>The Moon</em>.
        Nothing further was found, so they returned to Slate's family, and informed them of his fate.
        Pledging to find a way to return Slate to life, they turned over half the silver, splitting the rest between themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        That evening, Abe recieved a letter from his order, and S.A.M. had a vision from his god.
        S.A.M. set out to put this vision into motion, and Abe set off to visit the town druid, Ferrin Kastilar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next few days, the party spent on downtime:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abraham spent Thursday through Saturday working for Krag, helping to manage his and Eliander's library,
            in exchange for Krag helping him to research "organizations other than Abe's own that work with/against Fiends or Undead".
            <ul>
              <li>-1gp for Modest lifestyle Wednesday.</li>
              <li>3/7 days of helping Krag completed.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Dripp continued trying to befriend everyone in town.
            <ul>
              <li>-4gp for Modest lifestyle Wednesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese spent three more days in training.
            <ul>

              <li>-24gp for training.</li>
              <li>5/21 days of training complete.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            S.A.M. spent three days working on spreading the word of Moradin to the faithful, and getting supplies that would be needed to get the shrine re-sanctified as part of a proper temple.
            <ul>
              <li>-4gp for Modest lifestyle Wednesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        On Saturday morning, the party were all approached by messengers, summoning them to the Town Council's chambers.
        There, they met the five members of the Town Council, and were hired for a job.
        They were promised <span>400gp</span> upon return if they would assault the ship that had been working with the smugglers,
        'deal' with everyone aboard, and secure any contraband.
        The standard bounty would be paid out for the contraband, and anything else the smugglers had with them would be considered 'salvage'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party agreed, and that night, they were escorted to Caspar's home by two members of the town guard.
        They waited through the night, with Abe doing his best to repair some of the broken-down parts of the house.
        Eventually, they saw the signal from the ship, sent the return, and then rowed their way out to the <em>Sea Ghost</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boarding the ship, they were able to bluff their way on, and avoided letting the crew alert the officers right away.
        However, when they opened the door to one of the rooms on the top deck, they alerted the captain, who yelled out.
        The captain and a wizard were quickly dispatched, allowing the party to clear out their rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, the party proceeded towards the bow of the main deck, encountering a group of lizardfolk.
        The lizardfolk were hesitant to talk, but also didn't quite seem willing to attack the party, either.
        After some discussion, the party left the lizardfolk, and cleared out the rest of the main deck without problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party now started to explore the lower deck, working their way from prow to stern.
        First, they encountered five sleeping bandits.
        Reese attempted to steal the bandits' weapons before they awoke, but the noise started to wake them up.
        He was able to kill one bandit before she woke up properly, and then the party dispatched the rest of the bandits fairly easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, they checked the main hold, which held only casks and bolts of silk.
        After that, they proceeded to the officers' quarters on the lower deck.
        In one room, they faced off against the swashbuckling first mate, and in the other, they dealt with the deadly hook-handed Bosun, who had emerged into his room from a secret door.
        Having dispatched these two officers, the party prepared to head into the door, and see what lied beyond.

        Session 5
      </summary>
      <p>
        Opening the secret door aboard the Sea Ghost, the party met a sea elf.
        After some communication issues, he introduced himself to Dripp as Oceanus, and explained that he was from a sea elf tribe not far from Saltmarsh,
        and that he had been sent to investigate the Sea Ghost, as his people were curious what it was doing.
        While sneaking aboard, he was caught and imprisoned, and now he offered to help the party clear out any remaining pirates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearing out the rest of the ship, the party found Oceanus' confiscated weapons, <span class="loot">200 sp</span>, two <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing" class="loot">Potions of Healing</a>,
        a single dose of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/antitoxin" class="loot">Antitoxin</a>, and a number of <span class="loot">Maps</span>.
        They also found a second secret door, leading to a room with a large cache of weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confident that the ship was cleared of smugglers, the party headed down into the bilges. There, they found mostly trash, rats, and some rot grubs, who were quickly dealt with.
        They called for the two guards who had joined them on the raid. With the guards' help, they were able to get the Sea Ghost moving, and head back to Saltmarsh.
        Once there, they debriefed Eliander at his office, got paid for the job, and reached level 3.
        The party were also given use of the Sea Ghost as their ship, and a crew of eight for a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sea Ghost was promptly renamed Serenity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party then had eight days to themselves, to spend on downtime:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abraham spent four days finishing the work he was doing for Krag. After that, he spent four days doing something undecided that we'll figure out later.
            <ul>
              <li>-4gp for Modest lifestyle Thursday to Sunday.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Dripp spent a day scribing rituals into their new 'spellbook', then spent a week Carousing at the Empty Net. In doing so, they made a friend!
            <ul>
              <li>-8gp for Modest lifestyle Sunday to Sunday.</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese spent all eight days continuing his training.
            <ul>
              <li>-8gp for Modest lifestyle Sunday to Sunday.</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            S.A.M. spent two more days prepping to have the shrine turned into a proper temple. By talking to some of the local dwarves, and explaining Mafera's story, he got the help he needed.
            He also headed out to the local temple of Procan, and met with the priest there, Wellgar Brinehanded, who told him about Procan.
          </li>
          <li>
            The party also shelled out the money necessary to have Xendros try to get in whatever magic items she could get her hands on.
            The following were made available on Sunday the 23rd of Harvester, and will be available through Saturday the first of Brewfest:

        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        On Monday, S.A.M. was approached by Wellgar, with a request for help.
        A small town up the coast had a fort just up the road which had housed an order of paladins, the Templars of the Trident.
        The templars hadn't been seen for a couple of months, even just to get food and supplies.
        Some of the locals had checked the place out, but some sort of wailing noise had scared them away.
        Since the party had experience with investigating 'hauntings', Wellgar wanted to know if they would take a look into it.
        The party agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sailing out to the small town, the party were ambushed along the way by a group of goblins aboard a flotsam raft-ship of some kind.
        Armed with jellyfish, the goblins were able to poison and electrocute the party.
        Despite several waves being flung up onto the ship, including a boss armed with a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/1457143-jellyfish-whip" class="loot">Jellyfish Whip</a>,
        the party prevailed easily, and dispatched the goblins.
        Salvaging some lumber, and scuttling their ship, the party moved on to the town.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arriving at the town, the party were given instructions to the fort, and headed out.
        The bridge to the fort was rickety and broken, but Abe was able to lash it back into better shape using some of S.A.M.'s spare rope.
        Exploring, the party found a number of abandoned rooms, and stone spiral stairs which were collapsed leading downwards, but intact leading up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upstairs, the party met Serena Alexios, the undead last survivor of the Templars of the Trident.
        Serena explained that her order had been ambushed by Sahuagin, who had summoned some sort of foul devil.
        The Templars had slain the devil, but their numbers were thinned too much, and the Sahuagin had finished them off.
        Several templars had awoken days later, returned to un-life as Revenants.
        A counter-attack against the Sahuagin was mounted, but their priestess had prepared wards against the undead, and the Templars were weakened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only Serena had made it out 'alive'.
        The wards below were now strengthened, and she could not deal with the Sahuagin.
        But she was also bound to the fort by her new undead state, and could not leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Serena asked the party to help her see her duty fulfilled, that she might pass on.
        They agreed, and she offered them each the chance to pledge the oath of her order.
        Abraham, Dripp, and S.A.M. agreed, and recieved a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/other-rewards#Charms" class="loot">Charm of Heroism</a>.
        Serena told the party that if they continued up and around the fort, they would find an approach to the sea caves below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entering the caves, the party were able to separate the sahuagin, taking them out largely one-by-one.
        The priestess had been attempting to open another portal to the Nine Hells, to summon something quite large and nasty.
        But, because the spell was incomplete, Reese and Dripp were able to work together, and un-ravel the incomplete portal.
        As it closed, a single imp came through, but Reese was able to stab it and kill it before it could do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Returning upstairs, the party found that Serena had, in fact, passed on, with a slight smile on her face.
        The party returned to the nearby small town, where they were thanked, and told that the now-empty fort would be turned into a memorial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sailing home, the party had an encounter with some local Flying Fish.
        They were able to capture seven of the fish's wings, which they can craft into a one-time use of the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/color-spray">Colour Spray</a> spell (At first level).

      <p>
        Returning home from their travels, the officers of <em>Serenity</em> told Wellgar of the fate of the Templars,
        the Sahuagin and their portal, and were thanked for their troubles.
        They then spent a week around town, working on various things:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abe headed north to Burle, had a meeting with Castellan Kiara Shadowbreaker, and got a small payout for the smugglers the party'd taken out.
            He then spent the rest of the week participating in a local pit fighting ring, used by some of the local guardsmen, criminals, mercenaries, and such to blow off steam.

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Dripp spent the week performing in the city streets, using cantrips to entertain the town.
            <ul>
              <li>Comfortable lifestyle for a week for free.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            Reese got his training almost completed.

            S.A.M. spent the week working at Primewater Mansion, helping out the cook, a gnome named Feliza.

        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, Ferrin approached Reese, asking him to confirm that the party had, indeed, fought sahuagin up the coast.
        When Reese confirmed this, Ferrin explained that he'd conducted a ritual recently, using the power of Celene being full.
        Through that ritual, he'd come to find that the sahuagin were becoming more of a problem overall, in the area.
        He asked if the party might take <em>Serenity</em> to investigate a small group nearby,
        who had taken a number of animals captive, and were charging their kin money to see the animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party agreed, and <em>Serenity</em> headed out, with the officers easily able to approach in the Jolly Boat.
        Inside, they calmed things down with the two sahuagin in the cave, and were able to pay to see the 'animals'.
        The sahuagin toured them around the tide pools, and then tried to shoo the party out, but Dripp had spotted a tunnel underwater in one pool.
        Abraham kicked off a fight, and the two sahuagin were quickly dispatched.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the sahuagin was taken prisoner, and Dripp interrogated them, in hopes of tricking whoever was on the other side of the tunnel.
        That sahuagin was then killed, and the party started scouting through the tunnel.
        Heading through to the other side, they encountered a sahuagin, a sahuagin priestess, and two reef sharks.
        Once the sahuagin were both dead, the surviving shark stopped attacking, and the party were able to free the sea otters and giant octopus that the sahuagin had captured.
        They also got <span class="loot">70gp</span> and a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/driftglobe" class="loot">driftglobe</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>Serenity</em> then returned to town uneventfully, and another week passed without incident
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abe spent another week pit-fighting.
            <ul>

          <li>
            Dripp spent the week doing research on ways to help Slate, but didn't find anything.
            They did, however, meet Oceanus again at Eliander's place, who was there learning Common.
            Their last two days were spent trying to entertain the locals.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At the end of this, the <em>Serenity</em>'s officers were summoned to meet the council.
          They were joined at the meeting by Oceanus and Will Stoutly, who is in charge of Saltmarsh's marines.
          The council explained that the marines had scouted the area the lizardfolk were known to be, and they were asking the party to help deal with that situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eliander thought that the lizardfolk were allies of the Sea Princes, and preparing to attack Saltmarsh.
          The elves of Manaan thought that the lizardfolk were allying with their enemies, and preparing to attack them.
          The rest of the council weren't quite willing to believe Eliander, but were worried he might be right.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>Serenity</em> headed out, with Oceanus aboard, and the party headed to the Lizardfolk Lair.
          Taking Gellan's laughing suggestion to be a good idea, they knocked on the main gate.
          They were taken by guards, stipped of their weapons, and led them to minister, Sauriv.
          He chatted with them a moment, then they were escorted to the throne room, to meet with the queen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The party found that the lizardfolk were gathering allies, and among them were the evil Koalinth!
          The queen sent them out, to try to convince her people, and told them they had only a single day to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between them, the party were able to win over the commoners, guards, shamans, the minister, the queen herself, and the ambassadors of both the Locathah and the Merfolk.
          The Koalinth, meanwhile, left. They had decided they wanted no part in this war.
          Also, the party discovered the truth of the war; the lizardfolk were purchasing weapons from the Sea Princes, but nothing more.
          The war preparations were to defeat sahuagin, who had invaded the lizardfolk's true lair a year before.
          The lizardfolk don't know why, but the sahuagin have managed to sink some of the lower levels of the lair beneath the waves.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Queen Othokent and her people convinced to offer Saltmarsh a position within the alliance, the party reached level 4.
          As well, the queen offered two optional jobs for the party.
          The first, to kill a giant crocodile, Thousand-Teeth The Devourer, who was threatening the tribe.
          The second, to recover a stolen artifact of some kind from some Bullywugs in the swamp nearby.
        </p>
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Session 7</summary>
      <p>
        Agreeing to both of Queen Othokent's tasks, the party set out with their new lizardfolk guides.
        First, they would head to the bullywugs' ambush, then to Thousand-Teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon approaching the ambush, Whiskers was sent ahead to scout.
        He found where, precisely, the ambush would be happening, which meant the party were able to send in only Abe and S.A.M., with Dripp and Reese being farther back, picking off targets.
        The first wave of the ambush were easily dispatched, but after most of them were defeated, the are got very noisy all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        At one end of the ambush, a large bullywug arrived, escorted by two ordinary ones.
        At the other end, their king appeared, riding a Giant Toad.
        And all around Abe and S.A.M., bullywugs rose to the surface, chattering and croaking, seeming to only want to watch the fight.
        The large bullywug reinforced his allies with strange, croaking, eldritch songs, but the party were able to drop all the bullywugs, and the Croaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        On his death, the king surged forward on his Giant Toad mount.
        The toad tried to eat Abe, while the bullywug king tried to kill S.A.M.
        Abe was able to stay un-eaten, and the party managed to kill the toad and its rider, at which point all the bullywug spectators retreated into the marsh.
        The king had been wearing the lizardfolk's <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/helm-of-underwater-action" class="loot">Helm of Underwater Action</a>, which was later given to the party,
        and his giant toad had crude saddlebags containing <span class="loot">325pp</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, the party headed further into the swamp, to chase down Thousand-Teeth the Devourer.
        On the way, Reese and Abe fell into a bog pit, and the others were ambushed by a pair of Shambling Mounds.
        Garurt and Vyth led one mound off into the swamp, while Dripp and S.A.M. engaged the first.
        As Abe and Reese emerged from the pit, Reese was able to warn everyone that the enemy would heal from lightning,
        and with that knowledge, the party were able to destroy the thing.
        It injured them a bit, but was unable to engulf and digest anyone before dying.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, they finally were able to rest up, press on, and make it to Thousand-Teeth's lake.
        On the approach, they spotted, and started to deal with, a pair of Giant Constrictor Snakes.
        The fight was noisy, however, and attracted the giant crocodile's attention.
        It approached, scaring off the surviving snake, and joined the fight, but was no match for the officers of <em>Serenity</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Removing its head, the party also skinned its hide, then headed back to Queen Othokent, who rewarded them with the bullywugs' stolen helm
        and a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing" class="loot">Potion of Superior Healing</a>.
        From there, the party headed back to <em>Serenity</em>, joined by Garurt, Vyth, and Oceanus, and returned to Saltmarsh.
        The council were relieved to hear about the lizardfolks' friendliness and concerned about the sahuagin threat, and began negotiations with the two ambassadors right away.
        With their reward of <span class="loot">700gp</span> in hand, as well as a <span class="loot">600gp</span> payment for Thousand-Teeth's hide,
        the party then had a week of downtime to look forward to.

      </p>
      <p>
        On <span title="Wednesday">Waterday</span> the 12th, the party's rest was interrupted.
        Abe recieved a letter from his order, thanking him for his good work so far.
        While reading it, a young, armoured, and recently-heavily-scarred woman approached him.
        She introduced herself as Sarra, a former knight of the Church of St. Eadrine.
      </p>
      <p>
        She explained that the church had been long-time allies of the Order of the Lycan once,
        but had changed over the years, but their most recent leader had changed things,
        shifting their focus from evil shapeshifters to shapeshifters of all kinds.
        They stopped focusing on helping keep the Dreadwood safer, and instead started hunting down any shapeshifter anywhere in southern Keoland,
        filling their prison with doppelgangers who hadn't done anything wrong, other than be a doppelganger.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, months ago, there was a jailbreak. The order were slaughtered, as were most of the doppelgangers.
        Sarra barely escaped, and was heavily injured.
        Since then, she wasn't able to find work; she's a trained warrior, so anything she could do well, her scars and injuries have stopped her from doing.
        But, she remembered that the church's treasury, hidden deep in their temple, had a cache of platinum pieces.
        If the party were willing to split the money 50-50, she would guide them through the temple to the treasury.
        All they would have to do, was deal with anything still inside that was hostile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party agreed, and they set out up the river the next morning.
        Stopping where Sarra indicated, they hiked into the hills, to the church's hidden temple.
        On the way, they found a dead elf, and then encountered the elf's killer, a hill giant named To'bar.
        To'bar was hungry. To'bar wanted gnome. To'bar knew the party had gnome. He smelled gnome. To'bar offered to trade a sword for their gnome.
        The party offered rations. The rations were too salty. To'bar didn't like the salty rations. S.A.M. offered to cook the rations. To'bar agreed.
        S.A.M. didn't do well. To'bar hated the cooked rations. To'bar got angry and attacked.
        To'bar hit S.A.M.. To'bar hit S.A.M. again. S.A.M. stopped moving. Dripp fed S.A.M. a potion. S.A.M. lived.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having defeated the hill giant, the party were able to take the sword, which Reese identified as a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/weapon-1">+1 Rapier</a>.
        Then, they proceeded to the hidden temple, which Sarra explained had once been more conspicuous, until their last leader had ordered them to be more secretive about everything.
        Proceeding inside, the party explored around, finding a number of corpses, some church members, and some doppelgangers.
        The only notable loot they found was <span class="loot">a small emerald</span> in the algae-covered cistern.
        As they explored, they eventually came to a room with two chests.
        While investigating them, one chest reached out with a pseudopod and touched Abe, sticking to him.
        It then opened, showing many teeth inside, and revealing itself to be a mimic.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Session 8</summary>
      <p>
        After dealing with the mimic, the party looted the other, mundane, chest.
        Inside were <span class="loot" title="20lbs, worth 750gp">religious texts and holy symbols</span>.
        Next, they encountered, and then backed away from, a choker in the church's mud room, before deciding that the main area of the church was otherwise secure.
        With that, Sarra showed them where the secret door was, that led into the old church, which had been converted into a jail.
      </p>
      <p>
        On entering the jail, Sarra was accosted by a pair of wraiths, one an Eadrine priestess, the other a doppelganger.
        The wraiths called her a traitor, and moved to attack.
        In the ensuing battle, Sarra was drained of much of her life, and nearly died, and Reese was also significantly drained, but the wraiths were ultimately defeated.
        Searching the cages in the makeshift jail led to no discoveries, but Sarra pulled herself together long enough to show the party to a pair of doors in back, one of which was the treasury she'd spoken of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the treasury were eight <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/holy-water-flask">Flasks of Holy Water</a>,
        three <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing">Potions of Greater Healing</a>,
        a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/weapon-1">+1 Mace</a>, and 250pp.
        In the other door was a small storage room, mostly with rotting food, wooden holy symbols, and other basic supplies.
        On the ground, however, was Sarra's dead body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sarra who was with the party reacted strongly to seeing her own body, and fell to the ground, nearly unresponsive.
        The party almost decided to kill her, but instead chose to talk to her, and she explained that she was, in fact, one of the doppelgangers who had been captive here, and her real name was Feign.
        The real Sarra had been responsible for the breakout, and had been hoping to get some of the unjustly-imprisoned doppelgangers out safely.
        One of the freed prisoners, however, had decided otherwise, and started opening every cage in the place, releasing everything that had been held captive.
        The situation has devolved into chaos after that, with the rest of the Eadrine cultists discovering what had happened, fighting breaking out everywhere, and nobody being able to keep track of who was who.
        Among that chaos, Sarra and Feign had fled to the storage room, but Sarra was mortally wounded on the way. They'd waited for the fighting to stop, and things to go quiet, and while they waited, Sarra died in Feign's arms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feign headed back to Saltmarsh with the party, hoping to be able to use their share of the money to build a new life for themself, and move on from what had happened.
        As <em>Serenity</em> headed back into the docks, another boat drifted in; a small fishing boat whose sails weren't set, and with no crew at the oars.
        A crowd was gathering to see what had happened, with Eliander and Eda trying to keep them back.
        The ship, the <em>Quipper Bait</em>, was one of Eda's, and should have had a crew of four, including the Halfling captain, Sylos.
        They asked the party to investigate, and the ship was found to be empty, as if the crew had simply gotten up and walked off.
        The only lead was a large, double-headed electrum coin with a symbol of Iuz on each face, and a series of lines carved into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking the coin to Xendros, she explained much of what was probably going on.
        Her former boss, Fehr, had stolen some artifact of Tharizdun from a cult of his in Seaton, hid it away, and then got himself killed.
        The coin was Fehr's, made by transmuting a gold and silver coin together with magic.
        He was a capable mage, if unreliable, and had previously been known to use traps involving banishment to the ethereal plane.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking again to Eliander and Eda, they showed the council members the coin, and were told that the strange lines resembled a rock formation on a small island out at sea.
        <em>Serenity</em> set sail the next day for that island, where they found six large rocks jutting out of the ground.
        One of those rocks had a slot carved into it, where the coin would fit. When it was placed inside, the sand swirled away from the middle of the rock formation, revealing a pool of water.
        Diving in, the party found a lower chamber cleared of water, with a dead fisherman's body, followed by another channel of water leading upwards.
        There, they were attacked by six giant eels, who nearly managed to kill Dripp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pushing on upward, past the eels, they found a room with a small stone altar, and seven burnt-down candles in a heptagon.
        Reese's experience with the arcane was enough that he quickly realized the functioning of the magic.
        Some sort of fiend had been bound here, and was powering magic that kept the fiend and the artifact permanently bound to the ethereal plane.
        Lighting the candles would bring them back into the material plane, but only for as long as the candles remained lit.
        Unfortunately, Fehr's work was sloppy, and lighting the candles would restore the artifact well before the fiend, meaning that it wouldn't serve as an effective guardian.
        It seemed that the fishermen had stolen the artifact and left, and had gotten themselves banished with it when the candles had run out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lighting the candles, the party prepared to engage with whatever fiend Fehr might have used.
        Instead, a tentacled aberration of some kind emerged, conversing with them.
        It explained that there was a simple way to undo the magics present.
        A mere sacrifice of a life, as a gift to Iuz, would make the artifact free to take, ending all the magics involved.
        It also explained that it was once a fiend, but was now something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being unwilling to sacrifice a life, the party instead moved to attack this creature.
        It fought hard, and proved resistant to Dripp's psionic blades, but ultimately was dispatched.
        On its death, the heptagon in the sand vanished, and the water behind the party bubbled and dropped, as all the enchantments on the island dissipated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Serenity</em> headed back to Saltmarsh, where her officers found that no crew had yet emerged from the ship.
        Exploring the Quipper Bait once more, the party found that they had returned, but were now undead.
        After killing them, the party found a strange fish eye on Sylos' body, which seemed to stare at anyone who looked at it.
        Xendros explained that this was because it held the power to transform anyone staring at it, into the the aberration the party had fought.
        Rather than hold on to such an evil and dangerous thing, the party gladly traded it for five doses of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/keoghtoms-ointment" class="loot">Keoghtom's Ointment</a>,
        one of which was immediately used to treat the Bluerot that Reese had acquired from the undead fishermen's rusted blades.
        They were also allowed to keep <span class="loot">Fehr's Coin</span>, which always lands on its side.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party then spent a few days relaxing, waiting for the upcoming celebrations of Wiccrhys.<br/>

      <p>
        Wiccrhys morning came around, and Ferrin and Wellgar showed up at <em>Serenity</em>, with a job for her officers to take.
        On this day, summonings of all kinds are easier, and all sorts of evil cults may attempt to summon powerful beings on this day.
        Each year, the two of them would put together their various divination magics, and make sure nothing nefarious was happening.
        This year, however, they could feel that something was wrong right away. Something powerful was being summoned.
        They'd pinpointed where; a small island avoided by supersitious locals due to a kraken skull long fossilized into the cliffs,
        and they hoped the party would go out and try to stop whatever was happening.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Session 9</summary>
      <p>
        Heading off to the island, the party successfully navigated their way around the storm.
        During their travels, they traded with a pair of odd dolphins, earning some fresh fish in exchange for some of their own salted meat.
      </p>
      <p>
        On arrival at the island, the officers found two ways into the cave system within.
        They could head up a small walkway to an opening in the cliffs, or investigate a small cave opening out in the water, that Reese had identified.
        Making their decision, they headed to the underwater cave entrance.
        Before heading out, however, one of the crew pointed out that the storm from last night was heading straight for the island, and getting stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Swimming through the current there was difficult, and the party were faced with some sort of fish-person.
        It was dispatched easily, and they proceeded further into the cave, though S.A.M. was exhausted by the hard swim against the strange current.
        On emerging from the water, they saw two more fishmen, accompanied by another whose appearance was completely different.
        The strange newcomer let out a psychic scream that stunned Dripp, but the party were able to defeat the enemies, and continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further in, they found more of the same enemies, accompanied by a number of cultists.
        The leader was using a chain mechanism to open shutters in the cave above, which triggered a whistling noise throughout the caves.
        As combat began, he smashed the mechanism used to turn the chains.
        Then, after the party cleared the cultists, he used the same psychic screech as before and tried to run away.
        The party were faster, however, and he was chased and killed before he could get to any other members of the cult.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reese scouted ahead, and found that the cult's priest was conducting a ritual of some kind with several cultists.
        The rest of the party worked together to figure out a way to close the shutters,
        with S.A.M. and Abe ultimately proving able to simply work together to haul the shutters closed.
        As the noise faded, Reese watched the cult leader dispatch one of the cultists to investigate.
        Reese laid several traps for the cultist, then the party headed into the main ritual chamber through the other path they had found.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entering the ritual chamber, the party found that the cult had summoned a kraken,
        with two of its tentacles rising up from the pool of water in the ritual chamber.
        The tentacles reached out, seizing Reese and one of the cultists.
        Fortunately, the kraken chose to eat the cultist, and then left without causing further harm.
        The priest's spells were largely shut down, and with his death, the cult was defeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exploring around, Reese found a spot where a prior passage had been covered over by a false wall.
        S.A.M.'s magic mace was able to smash through the flimsy false wall, revealing a burial chamber of the cult's original founder.
        There, they got <span class="loot">49pp, 532gp, 484sp, and 623cp</span> as well as a <span class="loot">pewter crown</span> and a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/rod-of-the-pact-keeper" class="loot">+1 Rod of the Pack Keeper</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the way home, the party rescued a fellow sailor who had been stranded.
        Greta Amberhair had an odd pedal-powered boat, the <em>Water Wagon</em>,
        which had been hired to transport some of Ferrin's supplies for the upcoming Wiccrhys celebration.
        After the storm the night before, her crew had been attacked by koalinth.
        The koalinth who had raided their supplies, killed some of the crew, and taken others captive.
        The officers agreed to give the <em>Water Wagon</em> a tow to Saltmarsh, and invited her aboard for lunch along the way.
        On reaching Saltmarsh, she was thankful, and offered the party a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/1494464-storm-boomerang-variant">strange, curved, magical weapon</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That evening were the Wiccrhys celebrations.
        Abe got to talk to some of the other members of his order, who brought him a letter from the Chief Warden, along with a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/1418332-blood-ruby">strange ruby</a>.
        Dripp met with Xendros, who asked if Dripp would join them later that week for drinks, as she had something to show Dripp, related to Dripp's telepathy.
        Dripp was quite surprised, as they had never told Xendros about their telepathy.
        S.A.M. had a brief chat with Manistrad Copperlocks about the soon-to-be-finished temple of Moradin.
      </p>
      <p>
        This then left the officers of <em>Serenity</em> with three days free.<br/>
        Downtime results:

            Abe went back to the local pit-fighting for two of those days, and spent the other simply relaxing.

      <p>
        On Friday, Xendros showed Dripp an interesting fact about the town jail;
        one of the cells is warded against all forms of divination magic and teleportation.
        Inside this warding, Xendros told Dripp of a ship, the <em>Emperor of the Waves</em>,
        which had aboard a highly secured box containing a number of moderately dangerous magical items.
        The ship had been lost at sea, and the wars upon the box meant that the ship could not be located.
        Xendros had recently gotten word that the <em>Emperor</em> had been spotted near Saltmarsh, perhaps a day's sail away for <em>Serenity</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the one hand, the Faithful Quartermasters' precautions meant that there would certainly be no outside interference, and the ship should be long-empty.
        On the other hand, Xendros didn't want to take chances, and <em>Serenity</em> had proven adept at dealing with a number of dangerous situations.
        She asked if they would check it out, and bring back the box.
        In exchange, as payment, she would provide each of them with a <span title="Anything from DMG Table G, or else from some non-DMG source but of similar power, pending DM approval">magical item of some power</span>
        She had a crate of some supplies for the party, as well:
        <ul>
          <li>Several sets of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/studded-leather" class="loot">studded leather armour</span></li>
          <li>Two <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/crossbow-light" class="loot">light crossbows</a> with two sets of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/crossbow-bolts" class="loot">bolts</a></li>
          <li>Five 50-foot coils of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/rope-hempen-50-feet" class="loot">rope</a></li>
          <li>Two <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/grappling-hook" class="loot">grappling hooks</a></li>
          <li>Twelve <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/torch" class="loot">torches</a></li>
          <li>Two <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/healers-kit" class="loot">healer's kits</a></li>
          <li>Six <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/antitoxin" class="loot">vials of antitoxin</a></li>
          <li>Two <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/potion-of-healing" class="loot">potions of healing</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The party agreed to help out, taking <em>Serenity</em> to the area Xendros had indicated.
        S.A.M. was able to accurately judge the local currents, and work out where the <em>Emperor</em> had drifted.
        She was a sorry sight, with all her rigging lost, a list to the port, and was riding low in the water.
        Towing her back to Saltmarsh would be impossible; she'd never survive the trip intact.
        Given the risk that the <em>Emperor</em> might sink, it was too risky to take <em>Serenity</em> there, or even to leave the jolly boat,
        so it was decided that the party would take a couple of the crew with them, to get the boat back to a safe distance afterwards.
      </p>

      <summary>Session 10</summary>
      <p>
        Heading aboard the <em>Emperor of the Waves</em>, the party started investigating.
        On the main deck, they found the original captain's office, with a profane altar of some kind.
        Dripp identified the altar as being decoted to some foul demon-god, around the same time that a number of spiders attacked,
        aided by a massive purple spider-thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The various spiders wounded the party heavily, but they were able to overcome the attack, finding the captain's log in the debris, as well as <span class="loot" title="100gp each">a sack containing ten small rubies</span>.
        A similar attack occured in the original navigator's office, where the party found more of the same spider creatures, as well as the original navigation charts.
        The navigator's office, however, was much harder to fight in, being thickly crowded with webbing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heading down, the party found that the bow half of the mid-deck was similarly choked with webbing.
        Therefore, they instead chose to start exploring the mid-deck from the stern, using the stairs in the captain's office.
        The first room they entered was a largely-abandoned galley, with a door towards the bow, and a barred hatch down to the hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving forward, they ran into a half-orc druid, with several giant spiders and a phase spider.
        Conversation and negotiation broke down quickly, and turned to fighting instead.
        The phase spider lurked among the party, but Dripp was able to keep the druid from using many of his spells, and the spiders were largely able to be killed.
        The druid fled further into the ship, dragging the party into battle with more monstrosities, giant wolf spiders, and more swarms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abe was first through chasing him, and identified that the hatch down into the hold was rotted and damaged.
        As a result, the party were able to get past it without falling in, chasing down the final spiders.
        The party looted the druid's belongings, getting the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Two <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/spell-scroll" class="loot">spell scrolls</a> of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gust-of-wind">Gust of Wind</a> and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-poison">Protection From Poison</a>.</li>

          <li>A <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-water-breathing" class="loot">Potion of Water Breathing</a>.</li>
          <li>A <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/cloak-of-protection" class="loot">Cloak of Protection</a>.</li>
          <li><span class="loot" title="Value per PC of 131gp 7sp 2.5cp">507gp and 199sp</span></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Searching the rest of the mid-deck, the only thing of note was the room at the bow, which held several strange, human-sized bundles wrapped in spider web.
        The party chose not to inspect those, and instead opened the barred hatch at the stern of the boat, down into the hold.
        In the hold, they were attacked by four ghasts, with S.A.M. able to turn two of them, allowing them to be rapidly cleaned up.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the ghasts defeated, Abe moved to pick up the box that Captain Xendros had sent them after.
        That was when the giant octopus attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
        A giant octopus's tentacles started slamming into the ship, cracking the timbers, letting water pour in, and slamming into everyone inside who was still alive.
        Abe grabbed the box, and the party made for the ladder up to the mid-deck.
        The ship shifted and lurched, its list going from a few degrees to almost thirty, but the party were able to mostly avoid slipping, and make it to the main deck.
        There, they found four maw demons who had been inside the human-sized spider web coccoons earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        The demons were wounded by the octopus, as were the party, and the fight was quite damaging, with S.A.M. going down at one point.
        When the demons went down, S.A.M. attacked the tentacles out of anger, and found that he was in fact able to discourage them.
        The party damaged the giant octopus enough to keep it from accidentally killing them as they waited for their approaching rowboat.
        Once the rowboat arrived, the party quickly transferred the box, climbed aboard, and rowed back to <em>Serenity</em> as the <em>Emperor of the Waves</em> sank.
      </p>
      <p>
        Returning to Saltmarsh, the party turned the box over to Xendros, who thanked them, and gave them the promised payment (tentative, may be changed prior to the next session):
        <ul>
          <li>Abe: Flame Tongue Greatsword</li>
          <li>Dripp: Cape of the Mountebank</li>
          <li>Reese: Bracer of Daggers</li>
          <li>S.A.M.: Scorpion Armour</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Session 11</summary>
      <p>
        Having gotten their rewards from Xendros, the party spent a couple of days relaxing in town, with S.A.M. finding that the new Temple of Moradin had been completed.
        On the morning of the 27th, Oceanus paid the party a visit.
        He was in town as part of his new responsibility as a messenger, co-ordinating the new anti-Sahuagin alliance.
        He told the party that his king's eldest daughter, Princess Tiliashanna Perlantasil, had been kidnapped.
        Details were light, but the party were able to get the location and a rough description of the ship that had kidnapped her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heading out, the party found the <em>Nostalgia for the Reef</em>, which turned out to be a ghost ship full of undead.
        S.A.M. was able to turn and destroy many of them, resulting in the fight rapidly becoming a rout.
        That rout then proceeded to the lower decks, where the party quickly cleared out a number of additional undead.
        After defeating the undead, the party found themselves with a number of situations to resolve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, the Princess was behind a magically-locked door. Dripp was able to open the door, allowing the Princess to be freed.
        Secondly, the lower hold had a number of prisoners, fishermen from a ship that had been raided the day before the Princess was taken.
        S.A.M. was able to find the keys, free the prisoners, and get them some food and water to help them recover.
        Thirdly, the ship needed to be looted. Searching around, the party found:
        <ul>
          <li>A total of <span class="loot" title="170gp each">680 gp</span> in assorted loose cash.</li>
          <li>A <span class="loot">fancy silk carpet</span>.</li>
          <li>Three <span class="loot">lanscape paintings</span>.</li>
          <li>Several <span class="loot">assorted small statuettes</span>.</li>
          <li>Two <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing" class="loot">Potions of Healing</a>.</li>
          <li>A <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/gem-of-seeing" class="loot">Gem of Seeing</a>.</li>
          <li>The captain's log, detailing the <em>Nostalgia</em> having been attacked by pirates that they killed, and the <em>Nostalgia</em>'s subsequent looting of the pirates' ship.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The last problem aboard the <em>Nostalgia</em> was the large sarcophagus that the undead captain had been guarding.
        There were a number of scattered notes, which the party were able to decipher with some effort.
        These indicated that there was something sealed inside the sarcophagus, which had leaked out enough to affect the captain of the <em>Nostalgia</em>.
        It was trying to devise a ritual that would un-seal the sarcophagus and free it, with blood sacrifices needed in the current working version.
        The party took the sarcophagus to Castellan Shadowbreaker of Burle, so she and the others of the Wild-Flame Pact might be able to destroy it properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resuming their downtime, the party were interrupted again on the evening of the 28th.
        Just after sundown, four bright lights appeared on the entrance to Saltmarsh harbour.
        These lights were rowboats, with each piled with burning debris and heading towards one of the ships in the harbour.
        One of the targets was <em>Serenity</em>, and the other three were some of Primewater trading's ships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dripp acted quickly, using their new cape to get themself and Abraham to the farthest dock, where they were able to both jump in and swim to the four boats.
        They found each rowed by a sailor, with a pair of magmins on each boat as well.
        The sailors and magmin were quickly dispatched, with only one of the boats being destroyed.
        Gellan thanked the party profusely, and offered to pay for any one <a href="Shopping.html">Superior Ship Upgrade</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party resumed their downtime, finishing with a total of five days spent this session, with the following results:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abe paid the 50gp for Captain Xendros to get in a selection of random magic items,
            and spent his remaining days using <em>Serenity</em> as a short-haul merchant ship.
            <ul>
              <li>-5gp for Modest Lifestyle.</li>
              <li>+37.5gp from working as a merchant.</li>
              <li>Random items will be available on the 5th</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Dripp spent all five days at Eliander's, using his library to try to research ways to help Slate.
            They spent an additional 200gp paying for access to additional research materials
            <ul>
              <li>-5gp for Modest Lifestyle.</li>
              <li>-250gp for research materials.</li>
              <li>5/5 days, results have been sent via Discord.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese spent the first two days trying to study the Philosopher's Stone book from Caspar's mansion,
            then spent the other three crafting alchemical items.
            <ul>
              <li>-5gp for Modest Lifestyle.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            S.A.M. spent the five days trying to research details of who might have been responsible for his being put in his current body.
            <ul>
              <li>-5gp for Modest lifestyle.</li>
              <li>Results have been sent via Discord.</li>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, the party started the installation of two ballistas and a mangonel.
        Modifications to <em>Serenity</em> began on the 1st, will be done on the 7th, and the ship will be ready to go on the 8th.
      </p>

    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Session 12</summary>
      <p>
        On <span title="Monday">Moonday</span>, Reese brought a concern to the rest of the party.
        A family of gnomes, the Tizzles, were supposed to have come to town for the weekly market, but hadn't made it.
        He'd been hoping to purchase an Alchemy jug from the family's mother, who was an accomplished herbalist and alchemist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heading out of town, the party searched all the way to the Tizzles' home in the hills, without finding any clues.
        There, they got confirmation that the Tizzles had left two days prior, and they also got one of the Tizzles' shirts, for Abe to use to track them by smell.
        Armed with that, they were able to rent horses and track the scent to an inn along the road.
        At the inn, they were able to learn that the Tizzles had stopped there two nights earlier, and left the morning before.
        On their way, they were planning to investigate White Ridge Overlook, a tower two miles from the inn, as the tower had been burnt several decades ago, and the sites of such fires can sometimes grow interesting herbs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arriving at the tower, the party found a smashed handcart, and several trolls in the courtyard around the tower, peering over one troll's entrails.
        Moving into position, they lured one of the trolls to the gate, and S.A.M. and Dripp were able to use their magic to slow the trolls inside the Hunger of Hadar.
        The acid and cold combined with the slow to make short work of the trolls.
        During the fight, however, the party had rocks being thrown at them from above, forcing them to head inside for safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside, the party found burnt remains of furniture, a barred door to an escape tunnel, and rubble where the East end of the tower had collapsed, crushing the stairs.
        They were forced to climb up, where they found a venom troll sleeping atop a bed of rotten meat.
        They set to sneak past the venom troll without waking it, and Dripp used Whiskers to scout ahead, finding a three-armed troll and another who had been scarred heavily by fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proceeding upwards, the party inadvertently woke up the venom troll behind them.
        The three-armed troll turned out to be a Cleric of some kind, who casted magic before attacking the party with tooth, claw, and a burning club.
        A lucky strike from Abe took off the fire-scarred troll's head around the same time the venom troll showed up, and from there the heroes were able to finish the trolls off,
        though several of them were nearly dead from the poison and magics by then.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Tizzles were thankful for the help, and Abe and Reese were able to get their cart repaired, so they could gather their things and resume the trip to Saltmarsh.
        Exploring around, Reese found the other end of the escape tunnel, and Reese was able to explore enough to spot a Black Pudding without it noticing him.
        The party rested up, and took on the Black Pudding. Abe's sword split it into four smaller puddings, which were able to bring S.A.M. to the edge of death.
        Nevertheless, they were defeated, and the party found a dead body in the tunnel, mostly dissolved, with a couple of vials being all that remained intact.
      </p>
      <p>
        With everything defeated, the party rode back to Saltmarsh after a long day.
        The Tizzles then gave the party a reward, and the total loot was:
        <ul>
          <li>A <span class="loot" title="Valuable, but mundane. Worth 200gp">ring</span>, worn on a finger on a necklace around the troll cleric's neck.</li>

    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Session 13</summary>
      <p>
        The next morning, Dripp awoke from strange dreams, as though they had been glimpsing fragments of someone or something else's dreams that night.
        They found that they had been sleepwalking, and that they had drawn six faces and a map.
        Scrawled across the pages was one word, over and over. Golbuldoolpulg.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asking around town, Eliander was able to identify one of the faces as Sergeant Wynna Rawley, who had failed to return from patrol the previous day.
        Some of the local fishermen at the Snapping Line were able to recognize two local fishers, Geoff Thorne and Hobbs Buck, who had left town the day before to go check some crab pots along the shore.
        The map was also identified as representing The Pillars, an area up the coast from saltmarsh with some stone pillars jutting out of the water.
        The area was known to be good for crab fishing, but dangerous for larger boats, and Geoff and Hobbs were probably fishing in that area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking out <em>Serenity</em>, the party approached The Pillars by rowboat.
        Whiskers was able to scout ahead, and identify several Kuo-Toa, as well as three people chained to one of the rocks.
        Climbing up, the party engaged the Kuo-Toa, with Reese freeing Sergeant Rawley during the fight so she could join them.
        Once the Kuo-Toa were dealt with, the party freed the other prisoners, and destroyed a strange salt pillar that was radiating some sort of aberrant energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prisoners explained that three others had been taken underwater earlier that morning, through a passage down in one of the pillars.
        After a short rest, Dripp secured some climbing ropes, and the party headed down to the caves below.
        Several eels ambushed the party, grappling at Abe and Dripp.
        S.A.M.'s magic was able to force one of the eels to drop Dripp, and the eels were then quickly dispatched.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proceeding further into the caves, the party found the three other prisoners.
        All seemed to be easily breathing the water via gills, and fled when approached, chanting "Golbuldoolpulg".
        Following them, the party found a weakened Aboleth.
        It asked for their allegiance, and tempted Dripp with promises of fame, money, and understanding of their curse.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire party refused, and Golbuldoolpulg was quickly defeated, with Geoff unfortunately perishing in the fight.
        Returning to Saltmarsh, the party were able to pay for Wellgar Brinehanded to ressurect Geoff.
        After all the excitement, the officers of <em>Serenity</em> took a well-deserved rest for a few days.
        During that time, Doranthil, a half-elf tailor and clothing trader among the victims, sent Dripp a fancy outfit as thanks, having never worked with feathers before, and taking it on as an interesting challenge.

      <p>
        On the evening of the seventh, S.A.M. overheard some of the dwarves at the temple talking about an attack on some of the local miners.
        They weren't there, but through basic gossip they knew that some of the miners had been working on another job, and had been attacked by "demons".
        They'd also heard that Manistrad was trying to get Eliander to send some guards to deal with the situation, but he didn't have the manpower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talking to Manistrad, she explained that Clan Copperlocks had taken on a contract to expand the tomb of the Stregones, a wealthy family that owned a large stretch of farmland in the area.
        There had been troubles from the start, with a minor tremor and collapse forcing plans to change, and with the head of the family being picky about things, but work was going along fairly smoothly.
        Then, the previous day, the dwarves were attacked.
        They'd fled the tomb, returned to Saltmarsh, and now Manistrad couldn't convince a crew to head back.
        She was planning to head out there herself the next day to smooth things over.
        If the party would go with her, she figured she'd be able to convince a work crew to go as well, and start work as soon as the tomb was safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further conversation with Manistrad and one of the survivors led to the party learning that there were two workers still inside the tomb, at least one of whom had died.
        In addition, the possible survivor, Fallund, had been visited by his twin daughters, Fallthra and Falkrunn, who were bringing him a homecooked meal while he was working a double-shift.
        The twins hadn't made it out either.
        Lastly, the party got a description of the creature as being a bulbous, four-legged thing, with razor-sharp teeth, and un-natural healing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next morning, the party headed out with Manistrad to the Stregone estate.
        Entering the tomb, they found a pair of troll beasts picking clean the body of the confirmed-dead dwarf.
        The beasts were easily killed, and behind a nearby door that the beasts had been scratching at, they found the collapse Manistrad had mentioned, and a terrified Fallund.
        He was weakened from hunger, thirst, and exhaustion, but once he was convinced to un-bar the door, he quickly fled out to the dwarven workers' small camp nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heading east into the other side of the tomb, the party found four sealed burial chambers.
        The Northern two were still sealed, but the Southern two had been smashed open.
        Evidence indicated that the first two chambers were magically warded,
        but before the party could figure out details, they were attacked by a four-armed troll coming in from a cave system that the miners had dug into.
      </p>
      <p>
        The troll attacked the party, and during the fight Dripp was able to restrict it from attacking, making it flee into the cave.
        There, the party found bones and carcasses from troll and troll beast meals.
        Further on, the troll cleared its mind and turned to resume fighting the party.
        It also yelled out, and called for two more troll beasts to join the fray.
      </p>
      <p>
        After dispatching the troll and beasts, the party searched around, found some gold, and then proceeded even deeper into the cave.
        There, they found the twins, Fallthra and Falkrunn, and helped them get out.
        While S.A.M. and Abe helped escort them, Dripp and Reese proceeded further into the cave, running into a second troll.
      </p>
      <p>
        This troll yelled at the party in Common, not Giant, and seemed angry about her daughters.
        Combat ensued, with the troll proving capable of spellcasting, launching a fireball and counterspelling some of the party's own spells.
        Despite this, the troll was quickly killed, at which point a ghost emerged.
        The ghost proved to be the true spellcaster, and continued attacking the party.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ghost wasn't able to possess a new target right away, and the party were able to destroy it despite its attempts to avoid them on the ethereal plane.
        Once it was stopped, the party checked the rest of the caves, and then headed back out of the tomb altogether.
        Dripp and Reese talked to Petro Stregone, and put together more of the facts, determining that the ghost had been the family's founder, Aurora Stregone.
        Circumstances of her death were unclear to Petro, and he hadn't known her to be a spellcaster of any kind,
        but she did indeed have two daughters who had died with her, and were buried in the other warded burial chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
        S.A.M. and Abe instead went to talk to the dwarves.
        Fallund, recovering from his ordeal, thanked S.A.M. profusely, and talked about his grandfather, who had been a priest of <span title="Dwarven god of war">Clangeddin</span>.
        Fallund had his grandfather's old prayer beads, and asked that S.A.M. take them.
        His grandfather had claimed them to have some magic, though Fallund didn't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the threat resolved, the dwarves recovered the body of the worker who had been killed, and were able to resume work.
        The party headed back to Saltmarsh with Manistrad, and she paid S.A.M. for his help.
      </p>
      <p>
        The total loot earned was:
        <ul>
          <li><span>200gp</span> in loose trinkets, coins, and other things among the trolls' meal remains.</li>

      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of this downtime, Abe realized he hadn't heard from Ferrin in a few days.
        The druid had been planning to investigate the Cerulean Strand, a strandplain which had apparently been scoured of sand.
        Abe gathered his friends, and they decided to head out to the Strand and see what had happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arriving at the Strand, they found that there was a large thunderstorm raging over the area.
        The sand had indeed been scoured away between the cliffs and the sea, and a Dust Devil swirled through the area.
        It flew into the party, slamming them and throwing them around, but they were able to disperse it and proceed onwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was an obvious large wooden door, and Abe noticed a small tunnel to the South.
        S.A.M. and Abe headed in the door, while Reese and Dripp headed into the tunnel.
        Both groups quickly ran into blue kobolds and guard drakes, resulting in a long fight through the tunnels and the carved-stone rooms they connected to.
        Abe was nearly killed, but the kobolds were defeated, allowing the party to stop and rest before proceeding onwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the rest, however, the party took the time to examine a potion in an alcove in one hallway.
        S.A.M. read the Draconic sign, which identified the potion as "A gift from Rytheria. Emergencies Only.", and stepped forward to grab it.
        The sand he stepped onto gave out, and he barely had time to jump back to the safer walkway.
        Whiskers was able to grab the small vial, which turned out to be a
        <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-speed" class="loot">Potion of Speed</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Down the last unexplored hallway, the party found a tall room, with stairs heading downwards around the room,
        and a large statue of Tiamat in the middle.
        Entering the room, the party found some dragon cultists worshipping the statue.
        Combat began, and a pair of guard drakes rose up through the stone stairs, but the party prevailed easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the fighting, Whiskers sat on the blue dragon head of the statue, unlocking the door forward.
        Through that door, they found a pair of additional cultists and a large crystal.
        One of the cultists activated the crystal somehow, causing it to glow.
        The pair fled, but Abe was able to take one down before they got away.
        The other activated a second crystal in another room, but then was killed.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the cultists dead, Reese stepped out onto another section of sand, towards where the party could see Ferrin, gagged and tied up.
        As he stepped forward, a Young Blue Dragon rose up from the sand and attacked the party.
        The dragon's lightning breath hit S.A.M. and Dripp hard, but Dripp's magic was able to stun the beast.
        They also managed to destroy one of the crystals, further weakening the dragon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fight with Rytheria was tough, but the officers of <em>Serenity</em> prevailed.
        Afterwards, they sought to destroy the remaining crystals, as well as some guard drake eggs.
        While doing so, Reese was ambushed by a kobold scale sorcerer, leading to one last running fight through the last stretch of kobold warrens.
        Dripp was nearly killed, one sorcerer was killed, and two escaped, but the entire location was now empty and silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party looted the dragon's modest hoard, and then headed home to Saltmarsh, noting that the thunderstorm overhead was already breaking.
        Ferrin asked Abe to join him at his grove that evening, thanked him again for his help, and gave him a pin that he'd used back when he himself was an adventurer.

      <p>
        On the morning of the 18th, two men showed up to <em>Serenity</em> with a job.
        They introduced themselves as Tom Stoutly, one of the men in charge of Saltmarsh's marines, and Guildmaster Tabeth of the local Mariners' Guild.
        They wanted the party's help with Abbey Isle, a large island off the coast of Saltmarsh that was a significant hazard to local ships.
        With more and more trade in the area, Keoland had wanted to put a lighthouse there for years, but there was an abbey there of some religious order, who'd proven reclusive and paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pirates from Monmurg, however, had raided the abbey.
        Stoutly and Tabeth didn't know all the details, but the pirates' raid had been pushed back,
        and the guild had hired some of Stoutly's marines to help them deal with the pirates.
        The party were offered 2,000gp to head out, investigate the island, and make sure it was available for building a lighthouse.
        They agreed, and were told to head to a nearby island and talk to Major Ursa for more details, as he'd been more directly a part of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arriving at the smaller island, the officers of <em>Serenity</em> met with Ursa, who was the lighthouse keeper on the much smaller island.
        Ursa explained that the island was basically just a sheer rock, with a difficult climb and sharp rocks below the cliffs.
        The southern end of the island was the only place there was a beach suitable for landing was the southern end.
        The beach there, which Ursa called the Skull Dunes, was filled with skeletons hidden in the sands.
        Any time anyone tried to head up the beach, the skeletons would swarm up out of the sands and attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ursa didn't quite know how the pirates had gotten to the abbey, but suggested that the party could try to follow whatever path they'd taken through the sands.
        He also had no idea the fate of the abbey; the guild and marine forces had arrived as the pirates were fleeing.
        They'd routed the pirates handily, with only one ship escaping.
        Then, they'd witnessed smoke rising from the center of the island for two days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party took <em>Serenity</em> to Abbey Isle, and then took their boat to the Skull Dunes.
        S.A.M. was able to find a mostly clear path, almost getting to safety, but the party ended up in the wrong area, being ambushed by over a dozen skeletons.
        S.A.M. dispatched many of them by Turning Undead, and the skeletons were easily cleaned up from there.
        They then backtracked, and chose to head directly North.
        This led them into yet more skeletons, but the party had little difficulty clearing through them.
        As they thined through the skeletons, however, the party triggered a much stronger defense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every skeleton within 300 feet rose at once, and their bones separated and swirled around, forming into three large skeletal swarms, and a massive towering skeletal juggernaut.
        The swarms surged forward, attacking S.A.M. and Abe, but were destroyed just before the juggernaut could catch up to the party.
        The juggernaut wasn't able to hold together solidly, and once the party damaged it, it started falling apart on its own.
        This helped the party to quickly destroy the juggernaut, after which the Skull Dunes went quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the Skull Dunes cleared, the party proceeded along the island to the abbey.
        As they approached, they spotted two people outside, chatting.
        Dripp teleported themself and Abe over before the party could be spotted, and together they managed to kill both guards before either could raise the alarm with any other survivors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exploring around, they found that nothing was left of the abbey except some of the foundation stones, ash, assorted scrap metal, and a sturdy basement/cellar door.
        Opening the door, they called down to the other survivors, threatening them.
        Abe and Reese then worked together to pour a lot of lamp oil down the stairs into the basement area, hoping to burn out the survivors, and Dripp sent in Whiskers to investigate.
        Whiskers spotted an <span title="Wood elf, red-brown hair, thin. Wearing chain shirt, carries a short sword and short bow.">elf</span>,
        an <span title="Slight bear, receding hairline, all gone grey-white. Looks 50ish. Skin tone isn't right for this region. Stained travel outfit over leather armour, carries a dagger, wears a holy symbol.">older priest</span>,
        the <span title="Tall, slim, dark hair. Early 30's. Wears heavy robes, has a holy symbol and a gold amulet on his neck.">head priest</span>,
        two more <span title="Splint Mail. Medium size, other features are obscured under the armour/helmet.">guards</span>,
        and four other <span title="Two have robes, the other two have what looks like scavenged leather armour from the pirates, along with stolen scimitars.">disciples</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party closed the door, set S.A.M. next to it to guard it, and started to set themselves up for a rest.
        That rest was, however, interrupted, when a painfully loud ringing noise erupted from the door, as Shatter blew the door apart.
        Combat began, with S.A.M. backing off away from the door.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Session 17</summary>
      <p>
        The battle with the cultists was hard-fought, with many of them having some degree of spellcasting.
        The guards in front were well-defended by magic, and the head priest was able to dispel Dripp's attempt at using Hunger of Hadar to catch a large group,
        but the cultists were steadily ground down and defeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the fight was winding down, the Elf Bard among them cast Invisibility and fled, then asked to negotiate their surrender.
        They introduced themself as Bayleaf, and explained that they were a mercenary hired to train the abbey's guards.
        They wanted passage off the island, but also enough pay that the party were effectively buying out their existing contract.
        After some negotiation, it was agreed that the party would pay 500gp, and Bayleaf would show them a hidden treasure in the remains of the abbey, which was well-guarded, but valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abe and Reese cleared out the cellar, and everyone stopped for a short meal before Bayleaf showed them the hidden door behind a curtain, then headed on their way to <em>Serenity</em>.
        In total, the party found and took:
        <ul>
          <li>A <span class="loot">recipe scroll</span> with some simple recipes for flatbread, fish stew, and a seagull loaf.</li>
          <li>Gardening tools, a keg of nails, a box of carpentry tools, three lanterns, ten flasks of oil, two 50-foot coils of rope, twenty torches, and two 10-foot wooden poles.</li>
          <li>Four <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/potion-of-healing" class="loot">potions of healing</a> in fancy crystal decanters.</li>

          <li>A <span class="loot">gilded tome</span> written in Primordial and something Dripp can't read.</li>
          <li>A <span class="loot" title="About 50gp in value.">large silver holy symbol</span> of this order.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/spell-scroll" class="loot">Spell Scrolls</a> of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/guidance">Guidance</a> and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic">Detect Magic</a>.</li>
          <li>Two <span class="loot" title="25gp value, each">vials of rare ink</span> which smell faintly of copper.</li>
          <li>A series of <span class="loot">five sky-blue leather tomes with copper trim</span>, ancient and fragile, detailing gruesome, harrowing, evil rites.</li>
          <li>A <span class="loot">strange golden medallion</span>, which the high priest had been wearing, and which Dripp put on.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        With the abbey itself cleared, the party proceeded to open the hidden door that Bayleaf had pointed out.
        Entering the doorway, they found a large room, with two minotaur skeletons and a bodak.
        When Dripp entered into the room they were in, the undead looked at them, looked at the medallion, then ultimately remained passive.
        The party were able to pass them by, then proceed through a door into a maze.
        There, a message read "Dear Thief: Good Luck".
      </p>
      <p>
        Proceeding into the maze, the party's keen senses, aided by the light of Abe's flaming sword, were enough to spot many traps.
        Each was disarmed or bypassed, and the party explored forwards until they found a mosaic pattern on the floor in one spot.
        Past the mosaic was another note, reading "Dear Thief: Your luck runs out here" above a door.
        S.A.M. took the party's collapsing pole, and poked forwards, setting off a glyph of warding.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that trap sprung, the party headed into that door, finding three ogre zombies and a large crystal statue of a minotaur.
        The zombies were again pacified by the medallion, but the statue was motionless and blocking the doorway.
        The party approached it cautiously, and Dripp tried touching the medallion to it.
        Upon making contact, the statue roared to life and attacked.
        The party were able to destroy the statue by using the zombies to obstruct it, and then headed through the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next section of the maze had a number of pits with illusions hiding them.
        Dripp was able to use the Gem of True Seeing to see past the illusions and guide the party safely.
        Then they used Unseen Servant and Whiskers to probe forwards and explore a bit, and the party eventually found another such mosaic.
        This time, the message said "Dear Thief: Enjoy the spoils of your effort"
      </p>
      <p>
        After that was yet another chamber, with a large jade statue, and what appeared to be a lot of treasure.
        When Dripp went to investigate, the statue awoke and attacked.
        After defeating it, the treasure was examined, and found to be fake.
        The statue had mostly crumbled into dust, but there was <span class="loot">150gp worth of loose jade bits</span> that hadn't crumbled entirely.
        The one locked strongbox was opened, and contained rags and another message, "Dear Thief: A lot of work for nothing, wasn’t it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind the strongbox, the party noticed a secret door. Heading through, they found another message, reading "Dear Thief: Think you’re clever? Best of luck with this".
        That message hid another secret door, behind which was a room made entirely of black iron.
        Dripp used the Gem of True Seeing, and found that the room was merely illusioned to feel hot and look like black iron.
        As they did so, the party observed a shift in the shimmer of the heat.
        To everyone but Dripp, two large iron golems appeared between the pillars in the middle of the room.
        To Dripp, the golems merely stepped out while the shimmering illusion hid them.
        The golems then moved to attack.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Session 18</summary>
      <p>
        The iron constructs were slow but brutal, with one hand made of a hammer, and the other hand a long blade.
        Charging forward, they situated themselves between the part members and spun rapidly, hitting almost everyone and causing severe injuries.
        After that, they fought more conventionally, but enough damage had been done that everyone except Dripp was knocked unconscious at some point during the battle.
        S.A.M.'s magical healing kept most of the party in the fight, but he himself was knocked out a second time near the end.
        While his periapt kept him stable, he was unconscious when the statues finally died, so the rest of the party chose to drag him into the room, close the door, and rest for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside that room, the party found bags, boxes and the like, containing many treasures:
        <ul>
          <li>Two small coin pouch, containing <span class="loot" title="25pp 5gp each">100pp 20gp</span>.</li>
          <li>Another small coin pouch, containing <span class="loot" title="Two bits of opal and four bits of jade, 25gp value each.">assorted small gems</span>.</li>
          <li>A <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/wind-fan" class="loot" title="The fabric is diaphanous, and it almost seems as though it should fall apart at any moment, but it never does.">Wind Fan</a>.</li>

        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Retracing their steps, the party exited the abbey, and returned to <em>Serenity</em>.
        There, the officers found Bayleaf charming the crew.
        Dripp tried to match Bayleaf's charm, but only embarassed themself, which was quickly covered up by issuing hazard pay bonusses for the trip.
        The crew then set sail, and left the Isle of the Abbey.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they left, S.A.M. noticed that a ship nearby, the <em>Wavehammer</em> was acting suspiciously.
        The officers started discussing it, and the <em>Wavehammer</em>'s lookout called out to their captain.
        The ruse was up, as they dropped their Velunan flag and replaced it with the flag of Monmurg before moving to attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>Wavehammer</em>'s crew fired on <em>Serenity</em>'s sails, while the crew of <em>Serenity</em> focused on destroying the <em>Wavehammer</em>'s weapons.
        After some time spent closing distance and exchanging shots, the <em>Wavehammer</em> pulled up bow-to-bow with <em>Serenity</em>, and boarding began.
        The officers of <em>Serenity</em> were only mostly recovered from their earlier fighting, but Reese convinced Bayleaf to help, the boarders were repelled, and the <em>Wavehammer</em> captured to return to Saltmarsh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Returning to town, the party collected their reward for clearing the island, and turned over the <em>Wavehammer</em> and her crew, getting <em>Serenity</em> repaired in exchange.
        They then spent a day relaxing and doing other things:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Abe spent the day continuing his Giant training.

          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        On the morning of that rest day, the party got two leads on jobs they could take on, as well.
        The first was the lizardfolk ambassadors, Garurt and Vyth, with a tale about the nearby silver mines:
        <details>
          <summary>Garurt and Vyth's Complaint</summary>
          <p>
            Garurt and Vyth, the two lizardfolk ambassadors, have a bit of a problem.
            As part of the new alliance, a few of their people have been visiting Saltmarsh and the area, and vice-versa, trying to see if there’s anything that either people has to trade/etc. to the other, in the hope that stronger economic ties will make everyone more interested in the budding alliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of their people visited the various mines nearby, and while there, she saw a cliff whose side looked very similar to the lizard egg symbol of Semuanya.
            The resemblance is only superficial, but Queen Othokent wants to declare this as a sign that the alliance is blessed by their god, and have the cliff itself declared holy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clan Copperlocks are set to start mining out that cliff sometime next month.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is understandably going to cause some conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ambassadors have brought this up with Eda, but the senior councillor hasn’t been forthcoming with them on the issue since they first talked about it, and seems to largely be dismissing their concerns now.
            They wanted the party to bring things up with her, investigate, and find out what’s going on.
          </p>
        </details>
      </p>
      <p>
        The other was a letter from the town mage, Keledek:
        <details>
          <summary>Keledek's Letter</summary>
          <p>
            Captain Write and Company,
          </p>
          <p>
            Several miles southwest of Saltmarsh, across the mouth of the river, is the wizard tower of Zenopus, a mage I’ve worked with previously.
            He has not been seen in some time, and I believe him to be dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            While he was a vastly inferior mage to myself, he specialized in alchemy, illusionry and various rituals, so I wish to acquire his spellbook.
            Unfortunately, such spells shall also comprise his defenses, and take some time to unravel, which I can ill afford.
            My own workings require me to be home for some time each day for the next several months, so I’ll not be able to pull apart his defenses properly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, I’m seeking to hire someone to take a more brute-force approach, hoping his incompetence will allow such a thing to suffice.
            You and your officers have proven adequate at such tasks, so I offer the contract to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter the Tower of Zenopus, retrieve his spellbook, and bring it to me unmolested.
            In exchange, you may keep anything else you find within the Tower.
          </p>
        </details>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dripp went to Manistrad Copperlocks on <span title="Thursday">Earthday</span> morning.
        The councillor explained that the cliff was near a large silver vein.
        The clan had been mining nearby already, but the existing mine was attacked by a Xorn, and she'd lost people, and had to abandon the mine.
        Now, going back to the vein through that cliff was the only reasonable option.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also explained the basics of Xorn.
        They're earth elementals, usually found on the elemental plane of earth, or deep in the underdark.
        They glide through rock and stone, sniffing out gemstones and eating both those, and metal-rich deposits.
        Normally, they're not very aggressive, but this one was in a rampage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Armed with this information, the party headed to the mines.
        <em>Serenity</em> got them most of the way, then they took the boat up a small river to where the mine was.
        The entrance was a simple opening in a cliff wall, with cart tracks coming out, and some trees and rocks nearby.
        As the party approached, Abe's keen senses alerted him to a kobold in one of the nearby trees.
        He started to warn the party of the kobold's presence, but ended up alerting it that it had been spotted.
        The kobold yelled out "Attack!"
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Session 19</summary>
      <p>
        The party were swooped down on by a winged kobold, who attacked using unarmed techniques.
        Two other kobolds attacked from the trees using slings.
        The party easily killed the winged kobold and one of the slingers.
        The second slinger climbed down from the tree it was in, and tried to flee, but was caught and killed.
        Searching around, the party identified tracks indicating that more kobolds were likely inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proceeding into the mines, the party started by following the mine cart tracks.
        As they headed in, they found a door on the left of the mine caves, and entered.
        There, they found a pair of kobold inventors, working at a pair of workbenches, and surrounded by failed experiments.
        They engaged them in a fight, fending off pots of snakes, and several forms of blinding smoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the inventors tried to flee through a hidden passage to the outside, but Reese was small enough to chase after him.
        The inventor then surrendered, and was captured.
        The captive was interrogated, and the party learned that they considered the xorn to be "The Blessed One".
        Dripp then released the terrified kobold, giving it a healing potion and telling it to run away.
      </p>
      <p>
        To recover from the wounds they'd sustained, the party closed the door to the workshop, and stopped for a rest.
        After that recovery, Reese spent some time searching through the inventors' notes.
        He needed S.A.M. to assist with translation, but was able to get the gist of some of their experiments.
        They were working on smoke bombs, and had developed a version that didn't produce much smoke, but burned away at the eyes of anyone it was thrown at, blinding them.

        Heading back into the main passage in the mines, the party started exploring forward stealthily.
        They came to a pair of additional doors on the left.
        Taking turns listening at the first door, even Abe couldn't hear any sounds from inside.
        At the second door, still hearing nothing, the party opened the door carefully.
        In the chamber beyond, they saw a kobold with a rapier at its side, up on a ledge, bending over and doing something.
        Seeing this, the decision was made to close the door quietly, and proceed onwards.

      <p>
        The party have been told of the following bounties or long-term quests that they can turn in:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Kester's Obsession

              <li>Kiorna Kester, Saltmarsh's resident leatherworker, is obsessed with retrieving the hides of rare, exotic, and especially dangerous creatures, to work with.</li>

              <li>Success means the hide is in pristine condition, and can be sold to Kiorna for 100gp per CR.</li>
              <li>Failure means the hide is still obtained, but the payment will be lower.</li>
