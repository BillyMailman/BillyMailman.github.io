        <p>
          Our four intrepid adventurers, Abraham, Dripp, Reese, and S.A.M., met up on the docks of Saltmarsh,
          and agreed to work together to explore the abandoned and haunted home of Caspar Stiobhard.
          After hearing an old poacher's tales of a horde of ghosts, they did some shopping, met some of the locals,
          and then set off for the mansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arriving at the mansion after a few hours' walk, they split up to enter the garden inside the house's walls.
          Dripp entered through the crumbling parts of the wall, while Reese went in through the gates.
          Near the gates were four Giant Weasels, who attacked the party. Abraham was downed briefly, and tried to drag Reese back to their lair.
          After dispatching the weasels, the party rested for a bit, then proceeded in through the back door of the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, the party explored the kitchen, and found tracks leading through to the next room.
          There, they found a set of stairs. Stepping on the top stair triggered "hideous screams — as if of a soul in torment"
          to rise from the area below, scaring Reese for a time. Down those stairs, they discovered a wine cellar with a dead body,
          and were attacked by two Swarms of Rot Grubs. Once the grubs were dealt with,
          they took a suit of <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/plate">Plate Armour</a>, a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/longsword" class="loot">Longsword</a>, a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/shield" class="loot">Shield</a>, and an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/explorers-pack" class="loot">Explorer's Pack</a> from the corpse,
          as well as a single <span class="loot" title="Worth 50gp, its label bears &quot;the image of a jauntily dressed unicorn&quot;">bottle of rare wine</span> which had rolled under the wine racks.
          then took another rest before following the tracks into another room.
        </p>
        <p>
          This room had a large table, cooking stove, and a series of ten beds. Each bed had a footlocker at the base, bearing 7gp15sp, yielding total cash worth <span class="loot">85gp</span>.
          One door led out of this room to the East, one North, and a trapdoor back upwards to the West wing of the mansion.
          Before checking the other doors, the party tried the trapdoor. On approach, they heard a loud and malevolent voice yell "Welcome, fools — welcome to your deaths!"" Booming, fiendish laughter followed the spoken message.
          This time, it was Abraham who was mortally terrified and unable to calm himself for some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          After checking that the immediate upstairs room was empty, they went back down, and checked the non-barred door that headed North.
          This door led to a bedroom with a much nicer bed.
          Investigating that room yielded
          <ul>
            <li>An <span class="loot">oilskin coat</span> (Worth 5gp. Is fancy, floor-length, with a hood, and trimmed in iridescent green silk)</li>
            <li>A <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/lantern-bullseye">bullseye lantern</a></li>
            <li>Twelve <a class="loot" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/candle">candles</a></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">flint and steel</span></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">parchment, detailing some sort of signaling system</span></li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">volume of erotic poetry</span>, fully illustrated</li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">naval almanac</span> listing tide times for the area of coast around Saltmarsh (a total of one hundred miles of coastline is covered)</li>
            <li>A <span class="loot">treatise</span> concerning the demigod Iuz and its minions</li>
          </ul>
          The third book contained a <span class="loot">piece of parchment</span>, with some words/phrases in Common, next to other words/phrases in another language, spelled out phonetically.
          Further search of the desk in this room also yielded a <span class="loot", title="If you want the list, any non-wizard can spend a few hours studying it to work out what spells are inside.">wizard's spellbook</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not wanting to pass through the door marked Danger quite yet, the party retreated upstairs, and searched through the remaining rooms.
          The rooms in the West wing were searched. The first room contained three books which were damaged a bit, but still worth 7gp each:
          <ul class="loot">
            <li><em>The Magical Properties of Gemstones</em> by the archmage Tenser</li>
            <li><em>The Magical Properties of Herbs and Flowers</em> by the archmage Tenser</li>
            <li><em>The Metaphysics of Mathematics</em> by the mage Nystul</li>
          </ul>
          The third book had <span class="loot>"a note</span> inside. It was illegible from water damage, except the last two words, written in Common, "beyond skeletons." with no other details discernible.
          The last room in the West wing of the ground floor had a beaten-up desk, with a potion in a secret compartment, that contains <span class="loot">two doses of Potion of Healing</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, the party cautiously proceeded to the East wing, where they found two largely empty rooms. The first had <span class="loot" title="Worth 10gp each. Also, quite pretty.">two cut pieces of blue quartz</span>, and the second had nothing but plaster dust on the floor, indicating that the room upstairs has weak floors.
          Lastly, they explored the two rooms they'd so-far left unexplored in the North wing. One was empty, and upon entering the other and approaching the fireplace within, the party were swarmed by spiders.
