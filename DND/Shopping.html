    <h1>Shopping Guide</h1>
    <p>All the stuff you can buy in Saltmarsh.</p>
    <h2>Weekly Market</h2>
    <p>
      Open every <span title="Saturday">Starday</span>,
      the weekly market allows the purchase of any non-illegal items
      (no poisons, poisoner's kits, thieves' tools, etc.)
      from the PHB (Chapter 5), with a listed value of 150gp or less, always at a cost of what's listed in the PHB.
      Reminder: This includes basic healing potions at 50gp.
    </p>
    <h2>Winston's Store</h2>
    <p>
      Saltmarsh's general store allows the purchase of any basic PHB gear you would expect sailors, fishermen, or other locals to buy regularly.
      Ropes, oil, nets, buckets, candles, food and rations, etc.
      The cost is exactly as listed in the PHB.
    </p>
    <h2>Reese's Shady Connection</h2>
    <p>
      Reese has, through his understanding of Thieves' Cant and resulting ability to get along with the town's various criminal elements,
      discovered a location in town where he is able to buy some of the tools of less-savory trades.
      The proprietor there isn't very trusting of the rest of the party, so Reese has been told not to spread this fact around.
      Anything that could be bought at the weekly market, but is illegal, can probably be bought here at the listed price.
    </p>
    <h2>The Dwarven Anvil</h2>
    <p>
      Mafera sells most all forms of metalwork here. Her basic stock is things like hammers, nails, etc.,
      and her backlog is long, but she increasingly owes a debt to S.A.M. for helping to smooth things over between her and the town dwarves,
      so she's both willing and able to make things like standard weapons and most standard armour for the party with a few days' notice.
    </p>
    <h2>Kester's Leather Goods</h2>
    <p>
      Kester can sell basically any non-magical leather goods that anyone in Saltmarsh might want. 
    </p>
    <h2>The Faithful Quartermasters of Iuz</h2>
    <p>
      Captain Xendros is able to both buy and sell magic items. See the <a href="downtime.html">Downtime Rules</a>
      page for details of how to negotiate with her, including the value of magic items.
    </p>
    <h2>Temple of Procan</h2>
    <p>
      Wellgar Brinehanded will offer spellcasting services to others, though not always in exchange for gold.
      He is able to cast <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/class/cleric?filter-level=0&filter-level=1&filter-level=2&filter-level=3&filter-level=4&filter-level=5">spells from the Cleric spell list of up to 5th level</a>.
      He is also a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#TempestDomain">Tempest Domain</a> Cleric, so has access to a few more spells, but none of those are the sort of thing you're likely to need to buy in town.
