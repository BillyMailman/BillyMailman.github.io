    <h1>Character Creation Rules</h1>
    <h2>Race</h2>
    <p>
      Every race or sub-race in an official WotC-published book is probably going to be fine.
      Yuan-Ti Pureblood is a bit overpowered, but if you have a compelling character, we'll make it work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campaign is ostensibly set in Greyhawk, but Greyhawk's high-magic enough that things like the Warforged/Shifter/etc. from Eberron,
      Loxodons/Simic Hybrids/etc. from Ravnica, they'll all fit in well enough.
    </p>
    <h2>Class</h2>
    <p>
      All the official ones, including Artificer, are fine. Artificers are out of place in most 5e campaigns,
      simply because 5e is lower-magic than previous editions, but Greyhawk's pretty high-magic, so they'll work out just fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same goes for subclasses. All official WotC-published material works.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      All WotC-published backgrounds work.
      Per PHB (Chapter 4, section "Backgrounds", subsection "Customizing a Background"),
      I'm completely fine with customizing the backgrounds' basic features.
      Pick an existing background, use it for things like starting equipment and the Feature,
      then just pick any two skills, and any two tools/languages.
    </p>
    <h2>Backstory, Personality, Etc.</h2>
    <p>
      Your character needs to roughly fit in with Greyhawk(ish) and have a reason
      to be a level 1 adventurer looking for work in Saltmarsh.
      If you want to tie your backstory more closely into the plot, just let me
      know what you have so far, and we'll work out a motivation.
    </p>
    <h2>Unearthed Arcana</h2>
    <p>
      This stuff's probably all fine. Run it past me first, but I'm probably going to say yes.
    </p>
    <h2>Homebrew</h2>
    <p>
      Less likely to just get blindly approved, but there's definitely some good stuff out there.
      Bring it to me, and we'll see how it goes.
