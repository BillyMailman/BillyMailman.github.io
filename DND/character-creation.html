    <h1>Character Creation Rules</h1>
    <h2>Race</h2>
    <p>Every race or sub-race in an official WotC-published book is probably going to be fine.</p>
    <p>The only two races that regularly get called out as overpowered are the Aarakocra and Yuan-Ti Pureblood.
      Aarakocra flight is less overpowered if the campaign is indoor-heavy, which GoS somewhat is.
      Yuan-Ti pureblood Magic Resistance is absolutely bonkers to have been added to a player race like that.
      If it were the only thing they got, maybe along with Darkvision, it wouldn't be too bad, but adding innate spellcasting and poison immunity as well, is crazy. That said, if someone really wants to play one, let me know, and I'll work out a way to balance it.
      Probably I'll either tone down the resistance, or remove the other bits.
    </p>
    <p>The campaign is ostensibly set in Greyhawk, but Greyhawk's high-magic enough that things like the Warforged/Shifter/etc., Loxodons/Simic Hybrids/etc., they'll all fit in well enough.</p>
    <h2>Class</h2>
    <p>All the official ones, including Artificer, are fine. Artificers are out of place in most 5e campaigns, simply because 5e is lower-magic than previous editions, but Greyhawk's pretty high-magic, so they'll work out just fine.</p>
    <p>The same goes for subclasses. All official WotC-published material works.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      All WotC-published backgrounds work.
      Customization will probably be allowed; check with me first to be certain.
      In addition, there are four added backgrounds from GoS below. I've copied enough of them to get an idea of what they're like, but omitted the various tables for brevity.

        <header>Fisher</header>
        <div>
          <p>
            You have spent your life aboard fishing vessels or combing the shallows for the bounty of the ocean.
            Perhaps you were born into a family of fisher folk, working with your kin to feed your village.
            Maybe the job was a means to an end — a way out of an undesirable circumstance that forced you to take up life aboard a ship.
            Regardless of how you began, you soon fell in love with the sea, the art of fishing, and the promise of the eternal horizon.
          </p>
          <p>Benefits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> History, Survival</li>

            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Fishing tackle, a net, a favorite fishing lure or oiled leather wading boots, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp</li>
            <li><strong>Fluff Thing:</strong> <em>Fishing Tale</em> -
              You can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others.
              Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners.
              At the DM’s discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your actions.
              There's a table in the book to roll on or use as suggestions of what your character's tale is.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feature:</strong> <em>Harvest the Water</em> -
              You gain advantage on ability checks made using fishing tackle.
              If you have access to a body of water that sustains marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher,
              and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day.

          <p>
            You were trained for battle on sandy beaches and rocky shores.
            You have launched midnight raids from swift ships whose names evoke terror in the hearts of your adversaries.
            The water is your second home, the rain your shelter, and the crashing waves your battle cry.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Athletics, Survival</li>

            <li><strong>Fluff Thing:</strong> <em>Hardship Endured</em> -
              Hardship in your past has forged you into an unstoppable living weapon.
              This hardship is essential to you and is at the heart of a personal philosophy or ethos that often guides your actions.
              There's a table in the book to roll on or use as suggestions of what your character's hardship was.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feature:</strong> <em>Steady</em> -
              You can move twice the normal amount of time (up to 16 hours) each day before being subject to the effect of a forced march.
              Additionally, you can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists.
            </li>

        <div>
          <p>
            You have sailed into war on the decks of great ships, patching their hulls with soup bowls and prayers.
            You once helped build a fishing vessel that single-handedly saved a town from starvation.
            You have seen a majestic prow in your dreams that you have not been able to replicate in wood.
            Since childhood, you have loved the water and have been captivated by the many vessels that travel on it.
          </p>

            <li><strong>Fluff Thing:</strong> <em>Life at Sea</em> -
              Your life at sea and in port has shaped you.
              There's a table in the book to roll on or use as suggestions of how a life at sea has shaped your character.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feature:</strong> <em>I'll Patch It!</em> -
              Provided you have carpenter’s tools and wood, you can perform repairs on a water vehicle.
              When you use this ability, you restore a number of hit points to the hull of a water vehicle equal to 5 × your proficiency modifier.
              A vehicle cannot be patched by you in this way again until after it has been pulled ashore and fully repaired.

        <header>Smuggler</header>
        <div>
          <p>
            On a rickety barge, you carried a hundred longswords in fish barrels right past the dock master’s oblivious lackeys.
            You have paddled a riverboat filled with stolen elven wine under the gaze of the moon and sold it for twice its value in the morning.
            In your more charitable times, you have transported innocents out of war zones or helped guide herd animals to safety on the banks of a burning river.
          </p>

            <li><strong>Fluff Thing:</strong> <em>Claim to Fame</em> -
              Every smuggler has that one tale that sets them apart from common criminals.
              By wits, sailing skill, or a silver tongue, you lived to tell the story — and you tell it often.
              There's a table in the book to roll on or use as suggestions of what your character's tale is about.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feature:</strong> <em>Down Low</em> -
              You are acquainted with a network of smugglers who are willing to help you out of tight situations.
              While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community (DM’s discretion), you and your companions can stay for free in safe houses.
              Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle.
              While staying at a safe house, you can choose to keep your presence (and that of your companions) a secret.

    <h2>Backstory, Personality, Etc.</h2>
    <p>
      Greyhawk is a world where Mercenary Adventurer, the thing most D&D PCs effectively do, is a legitimate career path.
      Hell, the Yawning Portal in the city of Greyhawk manages to stay open while catering to essentially just that one slice of society.
      There are enough abandoned ruins, lurking monsters, and other threats, that this world is full of people who make their living keeping the world safe.
      Not every adventurer is in it for the money, but they're all defined by the fact that it's how they make most of their money.
    </p>
    <p>
      You guys, the players, get to decide why your character has chosen to go down that path, and why they've headed to Saltmarsh to do it.
      Maybe you all met up, formed a mercenary company of just the four of you, and are heading to Saltmarsh for your first big job.
      Or maybe you all just met each other on the road into town.
      Or maybe some of you know each other already, but not all of you.
      Maybe some of you share backstory.
      That's all for you guys to decide.
