        <h3>Repairing the Manor</h3>
        <p>
          Finished on <span title="Saturday">Starday</span>, the 8th of <span title="December">Sunsebb</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abe paid to have the necessary basic repairs done, and Stiobhard Manor is now in much better shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other repairs can now begin.
        </p>

        <h3>Abe's Bedroom</h3>
        <p>
          Finished on <span title="Monday">Moonday</span>, the 10th of <span title="December">Sunsebb</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abe paid to have a bedroom built (room 17 on the map), and did all of the work himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as he stays at Stiobhard Manor, Abe can now maintain any lifestyle for half price, needing to pay only for food.
        </p>

        <h3>Alchemy Lab</h3>
        <p>
          Finished on <span title="Wednesday">Waterday</span>, the 12th of <span title="December">Sunsebb</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reese paid to get Caspar's lab fixed up, the walls reinforced, ventilation improved a bit, fire suppression installed, bribed appropriate OSHA officers, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reese can make any number of <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/-rPX9Up4">alchemical concoctions</a> for full price at any time,
          and can make up to two/day by spending downtime, reducing the cost by half.

    <h2>Restoration rules</h2>
    <p>
      The following options are available to improve the manor.
      Each lists a requirement in terms of time, and gold, with the latter paying for both materials and labour.
      If you can't afford one in full, you're welcome to pay partially to get progress started, but can't make more progress on construction than the %-age paid.
      Any player character who wants to assist with a project is welcome to, but must have a relevant proficiency.
      For each day a PC spends assisting and supervising, subtract one day from the total time required.
      The gold cost won't decrease, however, and the extra day's worth of time must be paid in full.
    </p>

      <div class="panel info">
        <h3>Refurbish Bedroom</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: 300gp, 2 days.
        <p>
          One of the rooms (player's choice) will be outfitted as a proper manor bedroom.
          The exact details of what this implies, are up to the player.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will allow actually living at the manor, with better accomodations than your rooms aboard <em>Serenity</em>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="panel info">
        <h3>Refurbish Kitchen</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: 600gp, 6 days.
        <p>
          The kitchen will be made fully functional.
          The dining room will also be outfitted with a banquet table, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will let you hire a cook, host people for dinner, or anything else that requires the proper kitchen to be working.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel info">
        <h3>Docks/Storage</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: 700gp, 7 days.
        <p>
          Cleans up the area around the cave mouth, builds a basic docks.
          Also cleans up the caves themselves, allowing them to be used for storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allows <em>Serenity</em> to dock here directly.
          Will also probably have benefits to running a trading company out of here, if Abe (or anyone) continues down that path.

        <h3>Other ideas</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: ???gp, ? days.
        <p>
          I've just thrown together some ideas. Feel free to come up with your own uses for the rooms in the manor!
