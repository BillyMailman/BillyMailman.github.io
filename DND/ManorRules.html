    <h2>Restoration rules</h2>
    <p>
      The following options are available to improve the manor.
      Each lists a requirement in terms of time, and gold, with the latter paying for both materials and labour.
      If you can't afford one in full, you're welcome to pay partially to get progress started, but can't make more progress on construction than the %-age paid.
      Any player character who wants to assist with a project is welcome to, but must have a relevant proficiency.
      For each day a PC spends assisting and supervising, subtract one day from the total time required.
      The gold cost won't decrease, however, and the extra day's worth of time must be paid in full.

        <h3>Repairing the Manor</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: 1,400gp, 7 days
        <p>
          Repairs the walls around town, replaces the rotted floorboards, removes the broken furniture,
          and clears out any remaining debris left behind by Caspar or the smugglers.
          The manor is now guaranteed free of giant centipedes, giant poisonous snakes, giant weasels,
          stirges, rot grubs, green slime, and any and all forms of aggressive spiders.
          The rooms will mostly be bare, ready for further improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>This must be the first upgrade.</strong>
          No installing fancy facilities when there's still mold.
        </p>

        <h3>Refurbish Bedroom</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: 300gp, 2 days.
        <p>
          One of the rooms (player's choice) will be outfitted as a proper manor bedroom.
          The exact details of what this implies, are up to the player.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will allow actually living at the manor, with better accomodations than your rooms aboard <em>Serenity</em>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="panel info">
        <h3>Refurbish Kitchen</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: 600gp, 6 days.
        <p>
          The kitchen will be made fully functional.
          The dining room will also be outfitted with a banquet table, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will let you hire a cook, host people for dinner, or anything else that requires the proper kitchen to be working.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel info">
        <h3>Docks/Storage</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: 700gp, 7 days.
        <p>
          Cleans up the area around the cave mouth, builds a basic docks.
          Also cleans up the caves themselves, allowing them to be used for storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allows <em>Serenity</em> to dock here directly.
          Will also probably have benefits to running a trading company out of here, if Abe (or anyone) continues down that path.

        <h3>Alchemy Lab</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: 700gp, 7 days.
        <p>
          Gets Caspar's lab fixed up, the walls reinforced, ventilation improved a bit, fire suppression installed, bribes appropriate OSHA officers, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Will have some sort of benefit to Reese's alchemical tinkering/creation during downtime.
        </p>

        <h3>Other ideas</h3>
        <strong>Cost</strong>: ???gp, ? days.
        <p>
          I've just thrown together some ideas. Feel free to come up with your own uses for the rooms in the manor!
