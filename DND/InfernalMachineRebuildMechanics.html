    <h1>Infernal Machine Rebuild Mechanics</h1>
    <p>(Copied from the note in Foundry)</p>
    <h2>Dungeons</h2>
    <p>
      There are three dungeons ahead of you:
      <ul>
        <li>The Tomb of Horrors</li>
        <li>The Temple of Moloch</li>
        <li>White Plume Mountain</li>
      </ul>
      In all three cases, you'll be going there centuries in the past, all at the same past time as each other.
      Each dungeon has more of the components of the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad.
      The only completely required goal at each location is retrieving the components, though other goals may come up as you go.
      Once you have the components from a given dungeon, you'll gain a level on your next Long Rest.
    </p>
    <h2>Time</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You have a bunch (eight weeks as of the day you got the components installed in Gearbox).
      </li>
      <li>
        It's up to you how to spend it. Downtime or adventuring, it's up to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Time spent back in the past counts as time spent.
        Go back in time, long rest twice, and come back after three days, and three days will have passed.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the other hand, if you come back from the past, spend two weeks on downtime,
        then head back to the past, two weeks won't have passed. Some time will have, but not nearly that much.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Gearbox</h2>
    <h3>General</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Has AC/HP/Ability Scores/etc., but no attacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        As per Lost Laboratory of Kwalish, he still functions as an Orb of Direction and an Orb of Time, and he can cast the Light cantrip.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's your guys' decision whether I run him in Foundry, or one of you does. (Currently Tyler)
      </li>
      <li>
        Can be repaired by a check using Tinkers' Tools, or the Mending cantrip.
        Either option takes a minute, and restores him to full HP.
        Note that he MUST have at least one hit point remaining to be repaired.
        If he gets damaged to zero, it's not quite a TPK event, but you'll have to figure things out.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Charges</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gearbox has six charges, and regains 1d6 every day at dawn.
      </li>
      <li>
        He can spend ten minutes and one charge to temporoport the party.
        This can take you to the entrance of any of the three dungeons, or to Saltmarsh
        (Town Square or just inside the gates of Stiobhard Manor, your choice).
        <ul>
          <li>
            While doing this, he's considered concentrating, the same as if he were casting a long-casting-time spell.
            The charge isn't considered spent until the end, though.
          </li>
          <li>
            Yes, you can go directly from dungeon to dungeon this way.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        While in the past, he can attempt (as an action on his turn, if that's ever relevant) to spend a charge to manipulate time.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Results may vary. A lot, in some cases. Very little, in others.
            Some places do the same thing as each other, some do very different things.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there's no valid change for this area, I'll just let you know, and the charge is refunded.
            His action's still lost, though that likely doesn't matter.
          </li>
          <li>
            There may be options that require more than one charge spent on consecutive turns,
            in which case I'll let you know after you spend one charge.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        In general, charges won't be spent without effect, but you won't find out what happens in an area unless you try to spend a charge.
      </li>
    </ul>
