    <hr/>
    <h2>Untrue Giants</h2>
    <p>
      The lowest class, not strictly part of the Ordning. Things like Ogres fall here.
      They're not True Giantsâ„¢, but still have the basic attributes of being big and strong.
      Most of these are also extremely stupid.
    </p>
    <h2>Hill Giants</h2>
    <p>
      The bottom level that's part of the Ordning. Hill giants are largely big dumb idiots, being brutes and gluttons.
      They have a tendency to eat smaller species. A lot.
    </p>
    <h2>Stone Giants</h2>
    <p>
      The second-lowest level of the Ordning, Stone Giants are the scholars and artists of the giants.
      They generally live underground, and tend to consider anything not-underground to be essentially an entire world of dreams.
    </p>
    <h2>Fire Giants</h2>
    <p>
      The middle tier of the Ordning, tied with Frost Giants.
      Both are strong combatants, but fire giants tend towards forge work, being the crafters and artisans of the giants.
      They're often encountered in armour, wielding quality weapons.
      In battle, they are among the greatest giants at matters of tactics, but consistently struggle on matters of grander strategy.
    </p>
    <h2>Frost Giants</h2>
    <p>
      The middle tier of the Ordning, tied with Fire Giants.
      Both are strong combatants, but frost giants tend towards barbarian-style brute force, typically eschewing weapons.
      They're generally encountered without any equipment, or at most basic armour made from hides.
      In battle, they're generally brutish raiders, though do often fight alongside various tamed beasts.
    </p>
    <h2>Cloud Giants</h2>
    <p>
      The second-highest rank of the Ordning, Cloud Giants tend to be rulers of some sort.
      Historically, they tended to live in floating castles in the clouds, and some still do to this day.
      They also tend to be among the most benevolent of the giants, though that benevolence is tempered by a trend towards arrogance, and extravagance.
      Generally, all cloud giants are spellcasters, and reasonably good at it.
    </p>
    <h2>Storm Giants</h2>
    <p>
      The highest rank of the Ordning. Also the physcially biggest, and the most prone to violent tempers, even if they do trend to be good-aligned.
      Storm giants are often oracles, having a significant tendency to receive, and a strong regard for, omens.
      In combat, they're all powerhouses, having strong spellcasting. Do not use storm magic (lightning, thunder, or cold) against them.
