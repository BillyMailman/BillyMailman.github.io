    <h1>Shitty SKT Recap</h1>
      <h2>Session 1</h2>
      <p>
        On the road to Nightstone from Waterdeep, heading to complete a contract to clear out goblins.
        Head off the main road, towards Nightstone.
        Ten miles on, see the place.
        Nightstone is fuuuuucked.
        Boulders everywhere, buildings destroyed, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wargs eating a dog in the middle of town square.
        Kill the wargs, head to the temple, whose bell is ringing non-stop.
        Inside, find goblins ringing the bell.
        One dies, the other gets chased off.
      </p>
      <p>
        On to the town's inn.
        A goblin is busy looting the kitchens, but we kill it, then head upstairs.
        There's a person hiding up there who lies to us, but is obviously suuuuper evil.
        We run her out of town, too.
        Lastly, we clear out the lone goblin in the stables.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 2</h2>
      <p>
        On to the various farm houses and watchtowers.
        Deal with more goblins, some chasing chickens, some looting things, etc.
        Finally, we clear out the windmill, before sealing up the home of an Asmodeus priest, to use as a safe place to take a short rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the goblins are all cleared out, we tie ropes so we can cross the boulder-smashed section of the bridge.
        Shimmying people across, we get to the keep on the other island, head through the gatehouse, and then find people alive in the keep.
        The town's ruler is dead, some guards are alive, and they want to get her body to Waterdeep.
        Also, the whole thing was caused by a bunch of fucking giants in a floating castle, who stole the town's eponymous Nightstone.
      </p>
      <p>
        We stay in the keep for the night, with the ropes removed. LEVEL UP!
      </p>
      <h2>Session 3</h2>
      <p>
        In the morning, head back to town.
        Bunch of people there, including the woman from the inn.
        They're fucking Zhents, trying to take over after the crisis.
        We fuck 'em up, take some as prisoners.
      </p>
      <p>
        While getting horses sorted, the town is attacked by orcs.
        Without enough time to get out ahead of them, we choose to blockade at the gate and bridge into town, instead.
        Two guards come with, and we start fighting off the orcs while getting the bridge raised.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 4</h2>
      <p>
        Fight gets rough.
        The Eye of Gruumsh is annoying us with a spiritual weapon despite his goons being between us all.
        But, the bridge gets raised enough to block out the orcs, so the two leaders wander off, looking for another way in.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the death of the rest of the orcs that got inside, we finally hitch up horses, and ride off, smashing up the bridge controls enough that the orcs can't close off the town after we're gone.
        As we escape town, elves show up and finish off the orcs we left behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside town, on the road/in the woods, we rest up a bit (LEVEL UP!) and split ways with the guards.
        They're heading to Waterdeep with the surviving Zhents and the lady's body.
        We're heading towards the nearby caves, where any survivors may have gone after the giants' attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arriving at the caves, there's evidence of humans, as well as both larger and smaller creatures.
        Poking around, we see three different entrances.
        Testing the first, it leads to a spot with goblins and an ogre.
        The ogre's being lazy, but the goblins are distinctly on watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looping around to another entrance, we clear out a black pudding, then find that the path leads to the same damn big room with goblin guards and an ogre.
        Having no reason to think the third entrance will be any different, we charge.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 5</h2>
      <p>
        Goblins and ogres in cave. We kill through 'em all, and start exploring the caves more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter a large room, missing villagers being kept there.
        There's a hole in the ground, and whispering with the villagers, they explain that there's bats down there that'll swarm out and kill anyone who makes noise.
        We get everyone out of the cave, then resume exploring to find any more people/stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        While traversing corridors, we run into a goblin guard named Snigbat.
        She explains that she wants to kill the chief goblin, Hark. And she (correctly) guesses that we do, too, so she asks to help us.
        We head off to kill Hark together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hark is in a room with more goblins, and rats eating the body of a villager.
        We kill him, he kills Snigbat in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looting the rest of the place, we find another surviving villager and a lot of the villagers' belongings.
        We also find, and kick out, non-combatant goblins.
        With that done, we head back to Nightstone, where Morak the innkeeper gives us a reward, and a new quest.
      </p>
