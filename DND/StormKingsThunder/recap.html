    <h1>Shitty SKT Recap</h1>
      <h2>Session 1</h2>
      <p>
        On the road to Nightstone from Waterdeep, heading to complete a contract to clear out goblins.
        Head off the main road, towards Nightstone.
        Ten miles on, see the place.
        Nightstone is fuuuuucked.
        Boulders everywhere, buildings destroyed, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wargs eating a dog in the middle of town square.
        Kill the wargs, head to the temple, whose bell is ringing non-stop.
        Inside, find goblins ringing the bell.
        One dies, the other gets chased off.
      </p>
      <p>
        On to the town's inn.
        A goblin is busy looting the kitchens, but we kill it, then head upstairs.
        There's a person hiding up there who lies to us, but is obviously suuuuper evil.
        We run her out of town, too.
        Lastly, we clear out the lone goblin in the stables.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 2</h2>
      <p>
        On to the various farm houses and watchtowers.
        Deal with more goblins, some chasing chickens, some looting things, etc.
        Finally, we clear out the windmill, before sealing up the home of an Asmodeus priest, to use as a safe place to take a short rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the goblins are all cleared out, we tie ropes so we can cross the boulder-smashed section of the bridge.
        Shimmying people across, we get to the keep on the other island, head through the gatehouse, and then find people alive in the keep.
        The town's ruler is dead, some guards are alive, and they want to get her body to Waterdeep.
        Also, the whole thing was caused by a bunch of fucking giants in a floating castle, who stole the town's eponymous Nightstone.
      </p>
      <p>
        We stay in the keep for the night, with the ropes removed. LEVEL UP!
      </p>
      <h2>Session 3</h2>
      <p>
        In the morning, head back to town.
        Bunch of people there, including the woman from the inn.
        They're fucking Zhents, trying to take over after the crisis.
        We fuck 'em up, take some as prisoners.
      </p>
      <p>
        While getting horses sorted, the town is attacked by orcs.
        Without enough time to get out ahead of them, we choose to blockade at the gate and bridge into town, instead.
        Two guards come with, and we start fighting off the orcs while getting the bridge raised.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 4</h2>
      <p>
        Fight gets rough.
        The Eye of Gruumsh is annoying us with a spiritual weapon despite his goons being between us all.
        But, the bridge gets raised enough to block out the orcs, so the two leaders wander off, looking for another way in.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the death of the rest of the orcs that got inside, we finally hitch up horses, and ride off, smashing up the bridge controls enough that the orcs can't close off the town after we're gone.
        As we escape town, elves show up and finish off the orcs we left behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside town, on the road/in the woods, we rest up a bit (LEVEL UP!) and split ways with the guards.
        They're heading to Waterdeep with the surviving Zhents and the lady's body.
        We're heading towards the nearby caves, where any survivors may have gone after the giants' attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arriving at the caves, there's evidence of humans, as well as both larger and smaller creatures.
        Poking around, we see three different entrances.
        Testing the first, it leads to a spot with goblins and an ogre.
        The ogre's being lazy, but the goblins are distinctly on watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looping around to another entrance, we clear out a black pudding, then find that the path leads to the same damn big room with goblin guards and an ogre.
        Having no reason to think the third entrance will be any different, we charge.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 5</h2>
      <p>
        Goblins and ogres in cave. We kill through 'em all, and start exploring the caves more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter a large room, missing villagers being kept there.
        There's a hole in the ground, and whispering with the villagers, they explain that there's bats down there that'll swarm out and kill anyone who makes noise.
        We get everyone out of the cave, then resume exploring to find any more people/stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        While traversing corridors, we run into a goblin guard named Snigbat.
        She explains that she wants to kill the chief goblin, Hark. And she (correctly) guesses that we do, too, so she asks to help us.
        We head off to kill Hark together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hark is in a room with more goblins, and rats eating the body of a villager.
        We kill him, he kills Snigbat in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looting the rest of the place, we find another surviving villager and a lot of the villagers' belongings.
        We also find, and kick out, non-combatant goblins.
        With that done, we head back to Nightstone, where Morak the innkeeper gives us a reward, and a new quest.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 6</h2>
      <p>
        We get quests!
        Also, a cloud giant shows up with a flying tower.
        Prophecy led him to us, and he flew over to give us a ride.
      </p>
      <p>
        While heading to Goldenfields to deliver a flying cat, run into some goons who apparently work for Yan-ci Bin.
        They act like a bunch of bullying morons, and we easily convince Zephyros to kick 'em out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arriving at Goldenfields, we land outside, and come in through the main gates.
        Place is big, with heavy fucking walls.
        Guard at the entrance was a dick, but we get into town, get some shopping done, then go to inform the dude of his family's passing.
        He lets us keep the Tressym, and we spend a night in town.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early morning, we're woken up by an attack. Goblins, bugbears, and ogres roaming the city, looting and pillaging.
        Sorrel sends off his homunculus to warn the guards on the walls, and we help organize locals.
        Once things look okay at the inn, we head off into town, getting into a fight with a big group.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 7</h2>
      <p>
        After a rough fight, we clear the raiders, then get to the abbey.
        The abbot gets the bell ringing, which is the town's main alarm.
        We then get some more people to the barricades being set up around the inn, and head back there ourselves to plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorrel's homunculus returns, and we learn of the goblins' movements.
        In short, they're retreating now that the alarm has been sounded, and there were only three groups anyway, each about the size of what we already fought.
        We head off in search of another group, hoping to harass them as they try to get back to the spot where they first broke through the wall.
        Tracking them, we get to the wall, and start yet another fight.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 8</h2>
      <p>
        The fight on the wall is rough, since two Hill Giants come over the wall while we're cleaning up the ogres and goblinfolk trying to leave.
        At the top, we can see over the wall to the outside, where ogres with goblin huckers are sieging the wall, and even more forces are arrayed against us.
        Sorrel cast Sanctuary on himself, taunted the hill giants, and thereby managed to stymie their attacks for quite a while
      </p>
      <h2>Session 9</h2>
      <p>
        With the hill giants rendered ineffectual, we quickly cleaned up the fighting on the walls.
        To get the enemy to back off entirely, we threw the hill giants' corpses down, taunted the goblinfolk, and thus convinced them to retreat.
        With all this done, we took a break for the rest of the day, not leaving town until the following morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before heading out, we were asked for help by various people in Goldenfields, and agreed to most of the tasks.
        The first was in Amphail, along the way back to Waterdeep; Miros wanted us to "give his regards" to someone there, which is exactly what the party did, receiving a <span class="loot">ring</span> that we could use to summon a ghost to assist us.
        From there, we finished the trip to Waterdeep and cleared the second minor quest, giving a pendant from Zi Liang to the head butler of House Thann.
        He gave us some of Zi's old belongings - a <span class="loot">Handy Haversack</span> and <span class="loot">Potion of Gaseous Form</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, we headed to the lead that Naxene had given us - a "dragon expert" named Chazlauth Yarghorn, who would hopefully be able to direct us to a good-aligned dragon, in the hope that we could get dragon assistance against the giants.
        He didn't have any such leads, being only able to direct us towards a green dragon named "Old Gnawbone".
        He also helped out by giving us <a href="giants.html">information on the various types of giants</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Session 10</h2>
      <p>
        From there, the party were able to put out contacts with the Lords' Alliance, Harpers, Emerald Enclave, and anyone else we though might be useful.
        We told each group about the problem (Annam having ended the Ordning), and asked if any of them could find any leads, given the earlier prophecy stuff.
        While they tried to figure things out, we continued on the sidequests, heading to Daggerford to deliver a letter on behalf of Oren.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arriving in Daggerford, we found a town almost entirely taken over by the Zhentarim.
        The duchess had hired them as extra security in the face of the giant threat, but the whole situation smelled of the usual Zhentarim protection racket.
        Using Mikhto's ability to take spider form, we got some intel on the Zhents' leader, a corrupt loan shark.
        With that intel, Rick staged a heist, and we stole documentation of his usury, of the contract hiring the Zhentarim mercenaries, and of his collusion with the duchess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fleeing the town immediately after the heist, the party quickly got to Waterdeep, and provided the evidence to the Lords' Alliance.
        They told us to come back in the morning, and we had to deal with a Zhentarim assassin squad overnight.
        The next morning, the Lords' Alliance sent an inspector and a couple of guards alongside the party to return to Daggerford and check out the situation.
      </p>
