    <h1>Mission Changes</h1>
    <p>
      In mission 1, we no longer need to lead Penny back to the entrance, and Clockwork King spawns in the end room with her, so there's no need to go back to the entrance at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In mission 2, the Riders are buffed and colour-coded.
      See the <a href="#enemy-changes">Enemy Changes</a> stuff below for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      In mission 3, the sisters are in specific locations - Infernia near the start, and Glacia at the crossroads right before Dra'Gon.
      Also, the six other psychic hostages who normally don't matter, matter on Hardmode. Failing to rescue them, empowers the bosses at the end.
      See the <a href="#enemy-changes">Enemy Changes</a> stuff below for details.
      Lastly, we don't need (nor have the option, it seems) to lead anyone out - Infernia and Glacia will just join up and follow us (and probably die trying).
    </p>
    <p>
      In mission 4, the mission plays out basically as usual, though there's no need for Essence of the Earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mission 5 is the big one.
      The run to the end is exactly as normal, but once we get to the final room, the first difference is immediately apparent - we can't attack the portal generator things, so we can't try to spawn the Honoree early.
      Instead, we have to attack Hro'Dtohz until 50% as usual.
      But instead of the Honoree coming through the portal to join us in the fight, we will get sucked through the portal, and deposited onto a Rikti Mothership intact on the Rikti Homeworld.
    </p>
    <p>
      My understanding of things here is pretty fuzzy still at this point, but the basic idea is that we need to move downwards through the facility to the final room where we'll re-confront the bosses.
      There's some generator things to destroy along the way, and I genuinely don't know what the hell they do.
      Once we get the bosses defeated, the reactor goes critical, and we have to flee the Mothership back out the way we came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, it's worth noting that while inside the Mothership, Temporary Powers are disabled.
      This includes prestige stuff like ATT, so no using that to get people around.
      Once one person exits the Mothership, though, that person can just ATT everyone back to our own universe, and we're fine.
