    <h1>Basics</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://cod.uberguy.net/html/entity.html?entity=arachnos_lord_recluse_ssf">Lord Recluse</a> has resistances of <span class="resist-smashing" title="smashing">50</span>/<span class="resist-lethal" title="lethal">50</span>/<span class="resist-fire" title="fire">20</span>/<span class="resist-cold" title="cold">20</span>/<span class="resist-energy" title="energy">50</span>/<span class="resist-negative" title="negative">30</span>/<span class="resist-psychic" title="psychic">20</span>/<span class="resist-toxic" title="toxic">40</span>.
      So fire/cold/psionic are the best damage types but everything still at least partly works.
      He's also got 100 mag protection from Confuse Fear Stun Hold Knock Repel and Taunt as well as 87% resistance to any debuffs to his defenses endurance tohit accuracy perception movement regen recovery and range.

      As for his attacks he has the following:

      All the damage numbers then get a 33% increase because he's locked to level 54 and players are at most 50(+1).
    </p>
    <h1>The Towers</h1>
    <p>
      Each tower gives Recluse a ton of somewhat varied buffs. Stat-wise they themselves are AVs with 50% resistance to all damage
      and the usual object stuff; 100-mag protection from every mez except immobilize 100 mag perma-immobilize no regen cannot be teleported etc.
      They're also immune to tohit and recharge debuffs. The tohit resistance is meaningless - their stuff is <em>all</em> autohit - but the recharge debuff
      immunity means you can't slow down the spawn of the repair workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      While alive each tower below around 50% HP will start spawning repairmen. The spawns happen about once every 5s and spawn 1-2 workers at a time.
      When dead the towers should attempt one last summon and the repairmen explicitly have a power to rez dead towers so make sure to clear that final wave!
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong><a href="https://cod.uberguy.net/html/power.html?power=v_arachnos.power_generator.power_generator_real&at=boss_archvillain">Red</a></strong>
      tower is most responsible for Recluse obliterating tanks. It gives him hardcapped (i.e. 100%) resistance to
      <span class="resist-smashing" title="smashing">S</span>/<span class="resist-lethal" title="lethal">L</span>/<span class="resist-energy" title="energy">E</span>
      damage as well as +105% damage dealt with those same three types. It also puts him at the harcap of 4x magnitude to his knockback/knockup strength and stunned duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong><a href="https://cod.uberguy.net/html/power.html?power=v_arachnos.temporal_manipulator.temporal_manipulator&at=boss_archvillain">Blue</a></strong>
      tower is responsible for Lord Recluse being a hyperactive crack addict. It hardcaps his recharge speed triples his run speed gives him +30% tohit and
      causes him to become Untouchable for a second every ten seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong><a href="https://cod.uberguy.net/html/power.html?power=v_arachnos.protective_generator.dispersion_bubble_real&at=boss_archvillain">Yellow</a></strong>
      tower gives Recluse +200% defense (hardcapped at 175%) as well as an extra eighteen points of protection against holds immobilizes and stuns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong><a href="https://cod.uberguy.net/html/power.html?power=v_arachnos.healing_generator.empowerment&at=boss_archvillain">Green</a></strong>
      tower gives Recluse +2000% regen. It also has a <a href="https://cod.uberguy.net/html/power.html?power=v_arachnos.healing_generator.healing_pulse_real&at=boss_archvillain">heal power</a>
      that fires off every five seconds healing Lord Recluse to full and massively buffing his max HP.
    </p>
    <h1>The actual numbers</h1>
    <p>
      Once you add the buffs from the towers Lord Recluse's resistances start at
      <span class="resist-smashing" title="smashing">100</span>/<span class="resist-lethal" title="lethal">100</span>/<span class="resist-fire" title="fire">20</span>/<span class="resist-cold" title="cold">20</span>/<span class="resist-energy" title="energy">100</span>/<span class="resist-negative" title="negative">30</span>/<span class="resist-psychic" title="psychic">20</span>/<span class="resist-toxic" title="toxic">40</span>
      and his attacks, against a 50+1 target, look more like:

      As a final note, he has a 1.95x accuracy multiplier, and while the blue tower is up, he has a base +30% tohit, meaning the softcap sits at 75% defense.
      If you're using positional defense, he has attacks with all three positions, as appropriate. If using typed defense, his attacks do use a mix of Lethal, Energy, and even Toxic tags.
