    <h1>Vanguard AVs needed for the MDC</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every AV wears some form of Impervium Armour, which comes in Light, Medium, or Heavy.
          All three versions hardcap the enemies' perception, and add 5% tohit.
          All three give psi defense (20/20/35) and S/L/E resistance (15/20/20).
          Medium/Heavy give 30% toxic resistance, too.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the MDC fight, they're all 54(+1).
        </li>
        <li>
          Most of the melee ones have Swift and/or Hurdle, literally from the Fitness powerset. Keeps them mobile.
        </li>
        <li>
          TODO: Document the Relentless buff, and AV versus Praetorian AV versus Challenge AV
        </li>
        <li>
          Tactics/Assault are spread across them. Assault is +15% damage and the usual taunt/placate resist. Tactics is +25% tohit, and the usual confuse/perception stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding up all sources of tohit puts them around 170-190% base tohit, depending on whether Gaussian's summons are up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unless otherwise noted, their AV resistance stuff is on a 75s cycle, and gives mag 50 protection to Confused, Afraid, Terrorized, Held, Stunned, Sleep, and OnlyAffectsSelf for 50s.
          It also gives 90% resist(KB, KU, Repel) the whole time, 100 mag repel protection the whole time, and 100 mag KB/KU protection for 73s.
          They all have 85% resistance to debuffs. Each one's listing below will state exceptions, but mostly they get this to endurance, tohit, run speed, perception, regeneration, recovery, accuracy, and recharge debuffs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <summary>Lady Grey</summary>
      <p>
        She's a pretty typical Dark/Dark defender. From Dark Blast, she has Gloom, Night Fall, Life Drain, and Blackstar.
        From Dark Miasma, she has Twilight Grasp, Fearsome Stare, Petrifying Gaze, and Dark Servant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her AV resist provides +500% extra recovery, making her functionally immune to drains. It does not, however, protect against stuns.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Dark Watcher</summary>
      <p>
        He has all the good stuff from Illusion (Blind, Flash, Deceive, Spectral Wounds, and the three summons).
      </p>
      <p>From Force Field, he has Force Bolt and Force Shield.
        His Force Bolt is a whopping 18 mag KB, and his Force Shield is single target, 10s recharge, and lasts four minutes, so he can slowly get it onto the whole group. It's 15% defense to SLFCEN and all three positions, 70% resistance to endurance/recovery debuffs, and 40% resistance to toxic damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for his Energy Blast, all those attacks do a mix of Energy, Smashing, and Quantum damage, the latter being entirely unresistable.
        Power Thrust is also mag 16 KB. Not as strong as Force Bolt, but be ready to get tossed around a bit.
        He can use the Energy Blast attacks (and force bolt) on Untouchable targets, meaning he'll shred Phantom Army and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
        His AV resist protects against the -range debuffs from taunt powers, but does not protect him from endurance or recovery debuffs, making him susceptible to draining.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Gaussian</summary>
      <p>
        His Vanguard Rifle has a Talsorian Bayonet (Lethal/Energy damage, and -40% resist to both), and does Burst, Plasma Blast, Willie Pete Round, and Flashbang Grenades.
        He appears to actually only have six flashbangs, which also have a 120s recharge and 15s duration. Burst does Energy damage on top of Lethal, Plasma Blast is heavy -regen, and the Willie Pete Round does -resist to L/F/E/T, and drops a strong burn patch.
        But the real gem of his rifle powers is the SIGIL round, which takes four whole seconds to activate, does lethal and energy damage, and has a 10% chance to do mag 8 stun and leave you with -50 max endurance for the next five minutes. This endurance debuff persists through death.
      </p>
      <p>
        His Energy Melee is mostly pretty ordinary, except that it's really Negative Energy Melee. Not Dark Melee though - just Energy Melee with the usual stuns and whatnot, but flipped in damage type.
        Specific powers include Total Focus (always slow), Bone Smasher, Energy Punch, and Barrage.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Devices he has just Cloaking Device, which is pretty useless (1.5% defense and stealth that does indeed disable in combat).
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, he can call reinforcements, bringing a Colonel and Sorcerer from Sword to assist. They add one more of each of Assault and Tactics, and the Colonel has the same SIGIL round as Gaussian.
      </p>
      <p>
        His AV resistance protects against the -range debuffs from taunt powers, but does not protect him from endurance or recovery debuffs, making him susceptible to draining.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Serpent Drummer</summary>
      <p>
        From Martial Arts, he has Thunder Kick, Storm Kick, Cobra Strike, Crane Kick, Dragons Tail, and Eagles Claw.
        From Weapons Mastery, he has Shurikens, and Exploding Shurikens.
        All of these are exactly what you'd expect.
      </p>
      <p>
        His Super Reflexes comes in the form of Focused Fighting (-10 Confused, and 20% defense to Melee/Ranged), Inner Focus (-10 Confused, +20% defense to Melee/Ranged/AoE), Quickness (similar to the player version), and Elude (+30% to all defenses, big speed buff, crashes hard after 60s)
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, he has Fire Spirit, which basically summons a single Fire Imp, as an EB.
      </p>
      <p>
        His AV resistance does not protect against Confused, Held, or Slept, making him easier than most to mez.
        Confused will still be hard to do, though, as he has protection from his SR powers, and there's a bunch of 5-mag protection from each Tactics stack.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Levantera</summary>
      <p>
        From Katana, she has Sting of the Wasp, Gambler's Cut, Flashing Steel, Divine Avalanche, The Lotus Drops, Soaring Dragon, and Golden Dragonfly.
        Each is as you'd expect, except that her range is 5' for most attacks, not the 7' a player gets, and her Talsorian Katana does about a 2:1 ratio of Lethal and Energy damage. Every attack is also doing large amounts of resistance debuff, reducing your Lethal and Energy resistances.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Dark Armour, she only has Cloak of Darkness, giving 5% defense and some stealth that drops when she gets in combat.
      </p>
      <p>
        And from Dark Blast, she has Dark Blast, Gloom, and Blackstar.
        The only thing different from player versions is that her Blackstar has a chance to do extra negative, and a separate chance to do even more.
        If you take both extra hits (about 1/3 chance), you're looking at 6,822 negative and 1050 smashing damage, total.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her AV resistance does not cover Immobilize, allowing her to be locked out of closing to use her melee powers. She does still have 10 mag from Cloak of Darkness, but focused immobilizes can get through that.
        Also, while she has Swift boosting her run speed, she has no resistance to movement slows at all.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details class="panel wide">
      <summary>Borea</summary>

        From Katana, she has Sting of the Wasp, Gambler's Cut, Flashing Steel, Divine Avalanche, The Lotus Drops, Soaring Dragon, and Golden Dragonfly.
        Each is as you'd expect, except that her range is 5' for most attacks, not the 7' a player gets, and her Talsorian Katana does about a 2:1 ratio of Lethal and Energy damage. Every attack is also doing large amounts of resistance debuff, reducing your Lethal and Energy resistances.

        From Willpower she has Indomitable Will, which is just mez protection (see below).
      </p>
      <p>
        From Ice Blast, she gets Ice Bolt, Ice Blast, and Blizzard. Unlike Levantera, her Blizzard isn't super-powerful, since she summons the exact same pseudopet as players.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like Levantera, Her AV resistance does not cover Immobilize, allowing her to be locked out of closing to use her melee powers. She does still have 10 mag from Indomitable Will, but focused immobilizes can get through that.
        Also, while she has Swift boosting her run speed, she has no resistance to movement slows at all.
        Also, Indomitable Will means she still has protection to Confused, Terrorized, Held, Stunned, Sleep, KB, and KU, even while her AV resistance's protections are down.

        The big one up front is Lambent Flame. She warns players, then 3s later she fires off a 15' PBAoE effect.
        This does -50 end, -50% recovery, -16' perception, and massive amounts of energy and fire damage.
        There are four separate chances to do extra damage, but even just the bare minimum is about 2,200 damage, plus about 1,000 per second for the next eight seconds.
        And while the DoT is a 95% chance cancel-on-miss, and the four damage components I didn't mention are chances from 33% to 75% each, the power itself is autohit.
        At worst, it's 14,549 damage total. On average, it's 11,353 damage. Just the up-front damage averages around 3,952 - more than the Tanker Max HP harcap.
        This thing wipes teams.

        From the rest of her Light Blast/Light Manipulation blaster stuff, she has two ranged ST powers, an AoE, a cone, and two melees that stun.
        Think of her as an Energy/Energy blaster using Power Bolt, Power Blast, Energy Torrent, Explosive Blast, Energy Punch, and Bone Smasher.
        In fact, those are exactly the powers her stuff is based off (except using the Energy Melee icons for the melees).
        The difference is that her Light powers deal a mix of Energy and Fire damage, and all debuff perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also has Flash and Blind from Illusion Control, continuing her theme of using blinding light powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her AV resistance doesn't cover Stuns or Sleeps, but covers all the rest of the usual.

        The most obvious thing this man has, is Excalibur. He essentially gets Hack, Slice, Parry, and Whirling Sword from Broadsword, except that the damage is a 2:1:1:1 split of Lethal, Fire, Cold, and Energy.
        The descriptions dub this 'fae damage'.
        He also gets a taunt, which is built just like a Tanker's. Autohit, 41s duration on critters, 10.25s on players, -100% range strength, 15' radius, etc. are all normal, but the max targets is 32. The thing keeping it from being too punishing, is the 40s recharge.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Super Strength, he gets Rage and Foot Stomp. His Foot Stomp is 1/3 energy damage, though. And his version of Rage lasts only 30s, gives only +40% damage, and has the usual crash.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Sorcery, he has Rune of Protection. Shorter duration (30s), longer recharge (300s), but a whopping +80% to all his damage resistances. He also has Arcane Bolt, including the full Arcane Power mechanic.
      </p>
      <p>
        His Invuln stuff just consists of Unyielding, which is adding to the resistances listed in the table above, and adds even more mez protection to what's described below.
      </p>
      <p>
        And lastly, for good measure, he has a version of the Sonic Blast nuke, except that the damage is smashing/negative, not smashing/energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        His AV resistance has a 60s uptime for the mez protection, not 50. It's also ten mag stronger.
        It also gives him +500% recovery like Lady Grey, so he's functionally immune to endurance draining.
